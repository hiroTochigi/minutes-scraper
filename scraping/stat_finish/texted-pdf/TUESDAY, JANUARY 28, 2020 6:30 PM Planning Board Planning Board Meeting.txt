          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Waiting for one more 

member of the Board, but while we are waiting, I figure we 

might as well get underway, and start the meeting with 

updates from CDD, although before I do that, just a reminder 

to everyone that this meeting is being recorded, both video 

and audio.  So please be sure to use the mics, as 

appropriate.  So Iram?              

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Tonight's 

agenda includes a public hearing on an amendment to the 

Planning Board special permit for 40 Thorndike Street.  This 

is a little courthouse renovation.   

          And we also have a General Business item, which is 

Design Update for Cambridge Crossing Parcels G and H. The 

next meeting of the Board will be February 4, which is 

focused on Town Gown reports.

          So Harvard, MIT and Lesley University will be 

presenting, although we also have a report from the Hult 

Institute, which should be in your package.  But they will 

not be presenting this year.  This is the ultimate year. 

          February 11 is the following meeting, and then 

that will include multiple public hearings.  We will begin 

with a hearing on the incentive zoning amendment.  This is 

to change the incentive zoning contribution rate.   

          We concluded an updated Nexus and jobs linkage 

study last year, and forwarded that to the Council late last 

year, and forwarded it to the Council in December.  As a 

result of that, they have recommended that -- I mean, they 

initialed a consult zoning petition to update the rate that 

will be coming to the Board for that public hearing. 

          We will have a hearing on 34-36 Hampshire Street, 

special permit.   

          And then also a special permit amendment for a 

permit that the Board has granted for 541.   

          And we'll also have a BZA case at that time, and 

case or cases as well as an extension request for 51 New 

Street. 

          In terms of other items of interest, there are

several Ordinance Committee hearings that have been 

scheduled.  The Ordinance Committee will have their hearing 

on the Harvard Square Zoning Petition on January 30.  This 

is one that the Board has already heard and made a 

recommendation on.   

          They will have a hearing on Alexandria's -- 

continued hearing on Alexandria's Grand Junction Pathway 

Overlay District on February 4, Wednesday.  The Board has 

made a recommendation on that one as well. 

          And then on February 12, the Ordinance Committee 

will hold a hearing on the incentive zoning change.   

          And then on February 18, the following Tuesday, 

they will hold a hearing on a petition to amend the 

definition of family in the zoning ordinance.  So those are 

the updates from me.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you.  I 

believe we have no transcripts to approve tonight.  So that 

allows us to move right into our first public hearing.  So 

we'll be opening the public hearing on the Planning Board 

special permit 288, 40 Thorndike Street.  Are you going to 

kick us off, Mr. Rafferty?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Sure.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you.  Good evening Madam 

Chair, members of the Board.  For the record, my name is 

James Rafferty.  I'm an attorney with offices located at 907 

Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge.   

          I'm appearing this evening along with my Co-

Council, Attorney Anthony Gulluccio, representing Leggat 

McCall.  Present from Leggat McCall is Robert Dickey, an 

Executive Vice-President, and Huynh, the Project Manager.   

          The Design team is already present.  David 

Manfredi, from the Elkus Manfredi architectural firm and his 

associate, Rita Schroeder, is also present. 

          Tonight's application is an application for a 

special permit, for a project that the Board of course has a 

high level of familiarity with.  The original special permit 

in this case was granted in 2014.  By my count, four of you 

participated in the -- at least the final decision -- 

perhaps some of the deliberations as well. 

          Board members might recall that contained within 

that special permit was a provision to provide parking in an 

off-site location.  And there were two off-site locations 

identified in the application.  One was the First Street

Garage, and the second was the Cambridgeside Mall.   

          I'm pleased to report that after a great deal of 

effort, and an RFP process initialed by the city, that the 

City Council granted the request for a lease for the parking 

spaces in the building.   

          Board members might recall that that proposal and 

the City Manager's report to the City Council was reviewed 

by the planning Board, presented by Deputy City Manager 

Peterson, and this Board recommended to the Council that 

they adopt it, and the Council followed your sound advice, 

and did so. 

          In that process, however, there were two 

additional items attached to our approval conditions, if you 

will, for the vote -- the six-member vote needed for 

approval.  And both of them represent the substance of 

tonight's application.   

          The first was a request that the proposal include 

a reduction in the amount of parking, a reduction by 150 

spaces.   

          And the second component of the Council vote that 

brings us here is the conversion of -- the addition of an 

additional -- the addition of 24 more affordable units.

          There were a few other conditions in the vote, 

including a payment, a $3.5 million-dollar payment for 

additional affordable housing, as well as commitments around 

best efforts around locating a local operator for the 

proposed day care. 

          But the matters that are relevant here, and that 

are before you in terms of this application are approvals 

sought pursuant to Article 6, which allows a reduction in 

parking, and as well as the conversion special permit, which 

was relied upon in the original special permit to create the 

first 24 units.   

          So in this case, this application, or I should say 

this special permit will have the effect of modifying the 

original special permit.   

          Because we noted in our application the original 

special permit continues to have legal significance, and 

will be the operative special permit in the case of the 

building permit.  That's the special permit that allowed for 

the overall conversion of the courthouse, the finding by the 

Board under Article 8 that became the subject of significant 

litigation, as to whether or not the building qualified as a 

nonconforming structure, and was entitled to conversion

rights under Article 8. 

          So both special permits will have relevance, but 

the original special permit will be modified by this second 

special permit.   

          Tonight's application, we hope, clearly lays out 

the issues before the Board and the criteria necessary for 

approval.  The Board also is in receipt of a very well-

written, explanatory memo by CDD that spells out the two 

issues that I just described. 

          We also spent a fair bit of time analyzing the 

parking situation, and did so not only with our own traffic 

engineer, who is present this evening, but in addition, the 

working closely with the Traffic and Parking Department.   

          And there is a memo from TP&T that certain Board 

members have reviewed, which concurs with the conclusion in 

the study that the proposed reduction is appropriate. 

          So in addition to those items, the application 

itself identifies the history of the process, which we're 

not going to into now, since we know the Board has great 

familiarity with it.  But Attorney Gulluccio is going to 

share with you some of the elements of the lease process, 

the RFP.

          Because part of this project, and we suspect the 

Board views them as a whole, is the activity that will be 

going on in the First Street Garage.  Not simply the 

parking, but also the community benefits and active uses 

that are going to finally take place in the ground floor of 

that garage. 

          So Attorney Gulluccio will quickly address those.  

          ANTHONY GULLUCCIO:  Thank you, Jim, I got the hint 

the first time you said it should be brief.   

          [Laughter]  

          ANTHONY GULLUCCIO:  Ironic, isn't it?  First of 

all, thank you.  My name is Anthony Gulluccio, a partner 

with Gulluccio and Watson.  I was very pleased to be part of 

this project.  I see a lot of members of the community that 

were very active with our community process, which was 

extensive.                

          We actually had an office at 357 Cambridge Street, 

which was really amazing because I think it -- it gave us an 

opportunity since so much time had passed between the 

approved special permit and the lease process to reeducate 

and interact with the community on that.  And there was a 

lot of good work done there.

          But also just got a sense of understanding from 

the community what issues were important to them, and many 

of those were -- all of them in fact, were contained in our 

bid submittal.  You will see some of those as they 

transcended into condition by the City Council. 

          We heard about parking concerns.  We heard people 

wanted the onsite affordable housing.  The community was 

interested in support for local programs -- things like the 

East End house and Just-A-Start, local workforce development 

was a big deal, and something we heard about, supporting 

senior space, and there was a lot of interest in the 

childcare. 

          So -- and to be honest, it was -- there was a lot 

of concerns about the existing building, and just 

understanding how that building worked, and some of the 

issues that were contained within the building, and how this 

process would go forward. 

          As we moved to the City Council, that process kind 

of gave up no surprises when the City Council imposed the 

conditions on the lease that they did, really doubling the 

affordable housing contribution, both financial and the 

number of units on site, and also, asking -- we in the lease

offered a reduction in parking.   

          We had already heard from the community.  That was 

an issue through community meetings.  But an additional 

reduction in parking, beyond what was offered, and you'll 

hear more about those details as well. 

          And also, asking us to make good faith efforts to 

make sure that the childcare went to a local non-profit 

operator.   

          So I'm going to -- that was a condensed version.  

I would just say, because I know there's a few members of 

the public here -- these represented thousands of 

conversations, a ton of volunteer work on weekdays, 

weeknights and weekends, and just it was an incredible 

process.   

          I'd like to introduce Huynh, who she may have a 

technical role tonight, but I can just say that I don't 

think anyone contributed more to the project.  She just 

brought an incredible energy and sincerity to it.  And I 

don't think she wants to see me again for another five 

years, but we worked hand in hand together for a very long 

time. 

          DUONG HUYNH:  Thank you, Anthony.  That was 

Anthony subtly hinting Godspeed on our permitting process.

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]  

          DUONG HUYNH:  Thanks to members of the Board, 

Madam Chair.  So I'd love to -- before I go through what the 

connotations of the changes around the affordable housing 

and the parking, to also summarize the totality of the 

benefits that were covered, per the slide here, which will 

total $50 million dollars and above, in addition to our 

annual real estate taxes, our parking lease panel, and our 

capital improvements.   

          So based on the community feedback, and pursuant 

to the Council request that we double the amount of 

affordable housing unit, we, along with our architects, went 

back to the drawing boards.   

          And something that we are quite proud to share is 

that throughout that process, not only are we able to double 

the amount of affordable housing unit on site from 24 units 

previously located on the second, third and fourth floors on 

the Third Street side of the building, we have now been able 

to dramatically improve our unit mix.   

          So if you could refer to the table on the slide 

here previously of our 24 units, in the original special 

14

permit 288 from 2014, those 24 units actually comprised of 

eight market rate, eight middle-income, and eight affordable 

units.   

          They unfortunately back in 2014 -- and we're glad 

to have the opportunity to improve upon them now -- we 

weren’t back then able to deliver three bedrooms as part of 

the design constraints presented by preexisting structure of 

the building. 

          Now, in 2019 with our renewed design efforts, 

we're pretty proud as a team to say that we're able to 

deliver five units of three-bedroom apartments, and five 

units of two-bedroom apartments.   

          And that is a direct result of a lot of the 

community input -- folks who showed up to our early 

community engagement process, stating the utmost importance 

of allowing families to be accommodated on site, which would 

add to the vibrancy of the project and its programs. 

          So in addition to the conversion of a preexisting 

technical office space into those additional 24 units, as 

Attorneys Rafferty and Gulluccio have pointed out, we also 

are seeking a reduction of 150 parking spaces.  This is in 

comparison to the previous 512 that had been required in the 

15

special permit 288.   

          And as a summary, the residential ask here is that 

our project would have 23 spaces to serve the 48 units 

affordable housing, bringing that to a ratio of 0.48 spaces 

per unit. 

          Additionally, those eight -- out of those 23 

spaces, 18 of them will be housed in the upper of the two 

basement levels, so what we call Lower Level one in our 

plans.  And for your reference, that floor only houses 18 

parking spaces, so that makes up the totality of the 

residential parking on site. 

          Of the remaining parking spaces for the project, 

we are requesting that all of them be dedicated to technical 

office use.  So that will bring us 339 spaces to serve, the 

396,000 square feet of office.  And for your reference, that 

equates to roughly 0.86 parking spaces per thousand square 

feet of gross floor area. 

          Additionally, we have active ground floor uses 

that have remained programmatically the same from 2014, to 

which Mr. Manfredi will talk to the slight design changes 

that have occurred since, and positively.  But for those 

ground floor uses of childcare, other retail and restaurant,

we are seeking parking relief. 

          And so, with that, I would like to turn it to Mr. 

Manfredi to speak about the design changes for the project.   

          DAVID MANFREDI:  Good evening.  I am David 

Manfredi from Elkus Manfredi Architects.  As you can see, 

and as already been reported, the design changes that I'm 

going to discuss this evening really are only a reflection 

of changes in the program that came out of a City Council 

vote in September, and these have to do with the first, 

second and third floor of the building. 

          You'll see that modification in the podium, all in 

response to the changes in the residential program that 

Huynh just described.  And they are all limited to those 

lower floors.   

          I'll also show you the ground-floor plan, where 

we've made changes relative to layout -- some specific 

changes in code requirements since we were here over five 

years, some with regard to increasing some of the amenity 

spaces in the building, including the day care space. 

          So the ground floor -- maybe the most important 

thing to say is, and I think one of the most important 

public benefits from the physical planning point of view of 

17

this project, is we will continue to make all of the public 

realm benefits that were originally proposed, including all 

of the development of open space, publicly accessible open 

space on Spring Street, and the redevelopment of public 

realm all the way around the building, and correspondingly, 

changes in the elevation of footprint for probably about 75 

percent of that footprint.   

          Meaning that we're going to demolish existing 

elevated slabs, bring those slabs down to grade, so that 

these retail spaces can have direct access from the 

perimeter of the building.  The office lobby is fully 

accessible.   

          All of the east side of the building, those slabs 

are being redeveloped.  It's only this northwest corner 

where in fact the grade is higher than the elevation of the 

slab, but slopes down significantly.  As you'll remember, 

there are 13 feet of grade change from the northwest corner 

to the southeast corner. 

          Most of -- not most -- almost all of the public 

realm is exactly the same as it was back in 2014.  We're 

making some minor adjustments here with regard to that 

retail, and we have expanded that space.

22

          I'll point out a few other changes, and you'll see 

them in a comparison.  The office lobby, while its general 

configuration is the same, just minor changes in the 

footprint of the lobby.   

          We have expanded the residential lobby, because 

we're twice as many units.  We were 24, we're now 48.  And 

keep your eye on that elevator.  That is the elevator for 

the residences.  It goes from the ground-floor to the second 

and third floor.  It also goes down to the 18 parking spaces 

on Parking Level 1.   

          So if you're a resident and you park in the 

building, you will come -- you can come directly, you can 

stop on this level for packaging now, or you can go directly 

to your unit, without going outside the building.   

          DAVID MANFREDI:  So here's where the changes are 

on 2 and 3.  And you'll remember, those of you who were 

here, you'll remember back in the first review, the 24 units 

of housing were all on the west side of the building, on the 

second and third floor.  They were accessed off of that 

core, and it was a relatively simple configuration. 

          What we've now done is doubled the size, and so, 

we've doubled the amount of residential square footage on

the east side of the building.  And so, originally, 

residences were only on the west, now they're on the east.  

You will arrive by that elevator.   

          The circulation runs inside all of those units.  

It's about 48,000 square feet of residential in total gross 

area.  So do the math, it's about 1,000 square feet, gross 

square feet per unit, and I'm sure they are seeing 

residential units of much smaller dimensions and areas on a 

regular basis, we certainly are working in Cambridge and in 

Boston. 

          You can see there is a small amount of office 

space, facing to the south.  The two-story lobby remains 

basically the same.  So these are the office elevators.   

          They don't open on these floors, but there is a 

bridge -- well, I'm sorry, they do open on these floors to 

access these two spaces, and there's a bridge that connects 

across, as well as the connection includes these residences 

on the east. 

          On the third floor, again, that configuration of 

units that was only on the west side of the building, now 

comes across the east side of the building.  Again, there's 

some office space -- a small amount of office space on two,

a little bit more office space on three.  That's the office 

floor, that's the residential floor.  The residential guests 

and the office tenants, who are visitors, are completely 

separate. 

          This is our typical office floor.  It hasn't 

changed, you'll remember it.  There was a lot of columns, 

and that goes back to the original configuration, the 

alternating double height courtrooms and the office space 

around those courtrooms.  

          Huynh mentioned the lower levels and parking on 

the lower levels.  I just want to point out a couple things.  

This -- the access on the -- from the east side of the 

building from Second Street remains the same.   

          The number of parking spaces is actually reduced 

here.  There's now a total of 85 spaces, only 18 on this 

floor.  And that relates directly to reconfiguration, and in 

specific cases increasing in bike parking. 

          So all bike access -- again, is off of second, 

with direct access off the sidewalk.  Bike entry, ramp, to 

office park, bike parking, residential bike parking and 

retail bike parking are all separate.   

          The residents will come in, park their bikes, have

direct access to their core and elevator and as I said, they 

can either go directly to the lobby, or go up to the second 

and third floor.  These parking spaces will all be dedicated 

to residents.   

          And then the floor below is the full floor 

dedicated to parking, and that's all office parking.  And 

then you notice that that's the pit for the elevator.  That 

elevator does not come down, because there will be no 

residential parking on this lowest level. 

          I'll concentrate on the outside of the building on 

the first floors of the building, because that's where all 

the change is.  There is no change above that podium level.  

And so, I'll go around the building, and then I'll give you 

a comparison of the before and after.   

          But the real change is driven by the change in the 

uses inside the building.  So we'll start on the west 

elevation.  The entrance -- public entrance, sidewalk 

entrance to the residences -- basically in the same place.  

The lobby has gotten bigger.  This is day care to the north.  

This is retail space to the south, but you can see the 

amount of topography between Spring Street and Third. 

          We had originally, and still do, identified the

kind of publicly accessible realm of the ground floor.  This 

is in metal, and then all of the floors above primary 

cladding material is terra-cotta, and that's remained the 

same.   

          And -- but the pattern of fenestration has 

changed, in order that in this development -- new 

development of residential now on the perimeter of all of 

this, we -- what we've done here is really changed this to 

give us more flexibility in the development of the mix of 

units that Huynh described a moment ago. 

          And so, there is terracotta identifying that 

building entrance.  The breakdown of scale as you go around 

the building, we talked a lot about it five years ago when 

we talked about -- specify about scale of residential to the 

surrounding residential neighborhood. 

          Going around to the south side, the Spring Street 

side, you'll remember all of the public realm development of 

that publicly accessible space.  Access to these ground-

floor uses on both sides of the office address.  This is a 

through lobby.   

          So you can access the office on the south side of 

the building, you can access it on the north side of the 

23

building. 

          We've reconfigured this canopy a little bit.  But 

basically, what's really changed is I'm in with the 

residential, the pattern of fenestration -- again, directly 

affected by the way above units, inside the building.  

You'll remember that originally the residences were only on 

the west side, and not on the east side of the building. 

          The loading is still on Second Street, and that's 

accessed through the parking below grade, some of our 

utilities, and then access to our loading docks on the east 

side of the street. 

          You can see all of the development of that 

publicly accessible space on the south side really has 

remained the same.  I personally think the biggest -- as I 

said before, the biggest single improvement is that removal 

of the kind of moat around the building, the fortress-like 

security of the ground-floor of that building, and creating 

this very open base of the building, really on all sides, 

now on the north side -- again, that through lobby that I 

pointed out in the plan. 

          And this creation of a kind of datum of publicly 

accessible spaces, and then the residential units.

          And so, if you look at the building back in July 

of 2014 -- I guess we're getting close to six years -- you 

can see that what's really changed -- so this development of 

ground-floor or all the public spaces, outdoor spaces, has 

really remained the same.  What's changed is the residential 

now wrapping all the way around the building.  From that 

datum up, the building is the same as it was. 

          And so, what you're seeing is the change in units 

from to an inventory that was primarily smaller units to now 

more two bedrooms, three-bedroom units, and you're seeing 

that reflected in that pattern.   

          And again, if you look at -- again, from the 2014 

special permit and the 2019 special permit, that datum 

remains the same.  The street level really remains the same, 

and looks different -- not immaterial, but simply in the 

pattern of fenestration around the building.   

          Still the same idea that what we wanted to do, 

what we still want to do, is create the sense of these 

corners that the podium of the building is actually made up 

of several parts -- those several parts being the 

accumulation of residential units, the office lobby, which 

is two stories, and now we've repeated that on the east side

of the building, which was on the west side of the building. 

          And then my last exhibit here, again, we're 

looking now on the south elevation of the building.  It is 

more -- this is the previous -- it is more regular now.  

We've kept those open corners.  These will be great 

residences on both sides of the building, but we have a more 

-- a little bit more regular pattern, taking the basic 

rhythms of the layout of those units above. 

          I make one additional point.  Since 2014, building 

codes have changed.  We now require -- and I should have 

pointed out in our plan -- but the building code -- state 

building code now requires that there are as part of the 

firemen's lobby and access to the building two elevators 

have to serve all floors of the building -- lower level 

parking, all the residential and the office floors as well 

as the penthouse. 

          We haven't shown it yet, because we haven’t really 

laid it all out yet, but there will be a slight increase in 

the penthouse not to exceed six feet.  It's -- we've done a 

preliminary layout with our mechanical engineers.  That has 

to do with the addition of the elevator, mechanical 

equipment for that elevator, and we kind of reorganization

of equipment in that penthouse space. 

          That's it.  Thank you very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Do Board 

members have questions for the proponent at this time?  No?  

Okay.  Then we will go to public comment.  I don't have a 

ton of people signed up to speak.  A lot of folks have 

indicated their feelings, and indicated that they don't wish 

to speak, which is great for efficiencies' sake, we always 

applaud that. 

          So when I call your name, come forward to the 

microphone.  Give and spell your name and address.  Then, 

you will have three minutes to speak.  Please do limit your 

comments to the permits that are before us tonight.   

          We are specifically looking at the reduction in 

parking and the additional -- or conversion of the 

affordable units.  And let's see.  With that, Lee Pedro is 

the first person signed up who's indicated he wants to 

speak.   

          LEE PEDRO:  Good evening.  My name is Lee Pedro, 

of Roosevelt Towers in Cambridge.  And first of all, I 

wanted to say thank you.

          LEE PEDRO:  Thank you very much.  I'm so happy to 

be here after such a long, a long nightmare.  And I'm happy 

to see the new plans.   

          And because I've been an advocate, and I live in 

public housing, and I work with many seniors and families, 

the new plan with the two and three bedrooms really makes me 

happy. 

          And I can't wait until we have the senior part 

open and the day care.  And thank you, and I hope this gets 

voted on right away.  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Rich 

Vendetti?   

          RICHARD VENDETTI:  Okay.  Good evening.  I'm glad 

to be here, and thank you for your support all the time, not 

just tonight.

been a resident of East Cambridge for 68 years, five 

generations.   

          I've been involved with the zoning issues, and 

involved from Kendall Square to North Point to the Central 

Artery, so I've been around, I've seen what most developers 

have done to our community.   

          And this here, this here project will help us 

probably more than any has.  Not that they haven't in the 

past, but this here we've gotten as much as we could from 

them, especially with the affordable housing, which is going 

to benefit all of Cambridge, not just East Cambridge. With 

that, I thank you.    

Ellen Dera (sic).

Spring Street.  I live across the street from the 

courthouse.  I welcome the 48 families that will be moving 

in with all the rights to parking that I have, and please 

vote yes on this project.  I have six years of talking to

207 Charles Street.  I feel like, you know, you've heard me 

talk on this many times.  I just want to say thank you to 

the six Councillors who made this plan better for the city 

for our neighborhood.   

          I want to thank this body for voting on this 

multiple times to make this plan better for our city and our 

neighborhood, and I'm sure that we'll -- we're so close, I 

don't want to take a victory lap just yet, where we still 

have a lot of work to do holding the developers' feet to the 

fire to make sure they score on what we're trying to -- you 

know, hammer home here with the more money, the more 

affordable units, and then, you know, more, you know, 

benefits for all of us. 

          So thank you very much for your support over the 

years, and hopefully the positive votes tonight.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Jay 

Wasserman?

support this, and I've been fighting this for probably close 

to a decade, when the state first was talking about selling 

it.   

          I think my only concern is, too much low-income 

housing.  I like the balance.  The original plan had a one-

third, one-third, one-third.  And I think in general that is 

the way to go.  I don't like this rich part of the city and 

poor part of the city.  It's much better to balance it out. 

          But obviously, we should go forward with this 

thing.   I know there are other people concerns with 

parking.  Someone who parks underneath that tower almost 

eventually night and every morning, going from work, I'm not 

worried.   

          I think I will probably be pushed in the garage 

most of the time, because the few spots I'm using are going 

away.  But that's what was going to happen anyways.   

          But that garage of ours is no longer completely 

empty as it was when I first used it 20 years ago. 

          But I always am parked right next to the stairwell 

right on Second Street, even now.  So it really is time for 

this thing to go forward.  The building is falling apart.  

It's filthy, we have to live underneath it.  It's time for

us to move forward.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Heather 

Hoffman?   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN: Hello. Heather Hoffman, 213 

Harley Street.  I'm kind of amazed at how times change, and 

how things that couldn't possibly happen, like more housing, 

suddenly can happen.   

          And as Jay said, one of the things that was 

mentioned in passing, but was not mentioned as an amendment 

that you have been asked to approve is the disappearance of 

the middle-income housing. 

          There were -- the original permit requires at 

least eight middle-income units, that's gone.  Not that 

anyone cares, but it's gone.  And I think that there's a 

huge need in this city for that, and I think that it was a 

bad decision to do that. 

          I was interested to note that the residential 

entrance is on the side that is so windy that I've been 

knocked off my feet more than once in the winter.  And in 

the other inviting features, the so-called fabulous south 

lawn there, I remember a feature that didn't make it look as 

though all it was was a way to get into the building, but

that in fact invited passersby to use it.  And I don't see 

that anymore.   

          And I also noted that on the residential parking, 

two interesting anomalies.  Now, we're being told that 

somehow that that one floor, which has 18 spaces, is somehow 

providing 23 that they say.  My memory is that there were 24 

spaces.   

          So the residential parking is decreasing, and 

somewhere there are five spaces that you haven't been shown.  

So I'm thrilled that apparently to the things that couldn't 

be done to put in more residential units and larger 

residential units happened. 

          But as to the reduction, 30 percent nearly of the 

original parking, I just want to quote the Chair from just a 

few months ago in August, talking about the original number 

of parking spaces required in the special permit.   

          Here's the quote, "We did squeeze the parking down 

to a smaller number as, you know, my colleagues would let me 

get away with." So somehow, we can reduce it another 30 

percent, and it's only a few months later.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Heather --  

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  All of this I find just amazing.

Levy?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  And Elon 

          ILAN LEVY:  Hi, Ilan Levy, I-l-a-n L-e-v-y, 148 

Spring Street.  I'm coming because this is too good of an 

opportunity to think about the utility of the Planning 

Board.  And over the years, because we're planning, doing 

great things, telling us how we were not on the right page, 

and five years ago housing was not even on the table. 

          And to think that demand in housing was even 

outrageous, and the fact that we would do so was an 

outrageous act.   

          Same with parking, same with everything.  And, 

like, tonight, there was a possibility that you would 

actually deny this permit, it is laughable, right?  You've 

already permitted the thing once.  There's a reduction.  

There's more affordable housing.   

          This is purely theater, and doesn't serve anything 

else, but just to check the boxes in the legal process that 

the city has to undergo in order to permit and allow permits 

to go through. 

          The only ones who have suffered during those five

years -- 10 years actually that it has been going on, are 

the neighborhoods, the people in the neighborhoods, which on 

multiple occasions have been pushed one against the other to 

decide what was good and what was not good, because there is 

no Planning Board to offer us a vision for what should be 

versus what we want. 

          If five years ago you had talked about housing and 

anticipated that possibility the density that you had 

permitted in Kendall Square was going to have repercussion 

in the long-term on housing, that would have been a step 

forward.  But you didn't do that.  Are you going to do this 

today?  Probably not.  Are you going to do this on other 

projects?  Certainly not. 

          So the futility of the Board, the futility of the 

process is highlighted in its own beauty, it's entire beauty 

by this entire permit.  It is on the verge of the Monty 

Pythonesque and ridiculous.   

          And I'm sorry that you have to spend so many hours 

and so much time so that we can check boxes when decisions 

are prebaked into the system. It's outrageous in every way, 

and your lack of actually assuming the responsibility of 

actual leadership and of showing some kind of a vision and a

plan for the city is also kind of pathetic.   

          And I wish that it would change, but 

unfortunately, I know it won't, because you don't have that 

power. 

          Maybe you should actually request, like many of 

the new members that requested, that you actually have 

planning authority, versus rubber-stamping authority like 

you have now. 

          On that note, I hope that 2020 will offer 

hindsight 2020 vision, that looking back you will look at 

the future and have a little bit more wisdom when you make 

the decision.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  That 

concludes everyone who signed up indicating that they are 

interested in speaking this evening.  Is there anyone 

present who wishes to be heard on this?   

          DAN EISNER:  Hi, Dan Eisner, E-i-s-n-e-r.  Street 

address 6 Bristol Street.  You know, I sort of entered into 

this fight just about a year ago.  There are lots of people 

who were involved for many, many, many years longer.  And I 

sort of learned about the history and what was being 

proposed, I felt like this makes sense moving forward.  And

this was under the 24-unit plan. 

          And now that it's 48 units, and it's clearly a 

significant step up going from, you know, only a handful of 

two-bedroom units, no one-bedroom units and no three-bedroom 

units to the situation now, it's obviously an improvement.  

          So, you know, if you improved it before, clearly 

it should be approved now, and just, you know, thank you for 

all the work you've done over the years on this.  I'm sure 

you want to see it finally end.          

          COLLECTIVE:  [Laughter]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Is there 

anyone who hasn't been heard on this yet?       

          MARY FLYNN:  I'm not speaking for myself.  I 

needed to bring a message, just that they never spoke to the 

East Cambridge Planning Team about this.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  is there 

anyone else who's present and wants to be heard on this?  

Okay.  Board members, questions?  Anything for the applicant 

or for staff that you want to hear?       

          MARY FLYNN:  I have a question.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, Mary, let's 

start with you.

          MARY FLYNN:  So this is just a logistics question 

on a residential piece.  Because it's been noted that, you 

know, the entrance is on the west side of the building.  

And, but now the residential wraps around the entire 

building.  And I understand some folks would be parking in 

the garage, which is over towards the east side.   

          So how do I -- if I park in that garage, do I have 

to walk all the way around to the other side, or is there a 

way I can access -- if I live on the east side, is there a 

way I can access my unit by going through the office lobby, 

is there another way in?   

          DAVID MANFREDI:  You don't need to go through the 

office lobby.  So if you park in the garage --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yep.   

          DAVID MANFREDI:  You will be parking under the 

footprint of the building.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, I'm sorry.   

          DAN EISNER:  The first street.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I meant the First Street Garage.   

          DAVID MANFREDI:  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  

You'll, so if you'll park in the First Street Garage, the 

only entrance to the building when you go down -- sorry, I

misunderstood your question.  There's only one residential 

entrance, and that's on the west side.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, that strikes me as a bit 

of a problem.  Third Street is a very, very busy street, and 

it -- I'm new to this, so I haven't been through your 10-

year history at all, and so, it's very late to the game.   

          But just as an observation, you know, it's a very 

busy street and, you know, people will have packages being 

dropped off, guests being dropped off. 

          If you're not in the building's garage, it seems 

like it's going to be a little bit difficult to maneuver 

back and forth.  So it would seem to be helpful if it was a 

matter of a way to get into the floor, at least with the 

east side units. 

          Yeah, and mostly my concerns are drop-off -- you 

know, also with the childcare and things like that.  You 

know, it's just very, very busy around here, and I don't 

see, like, any dedicated drop-off areas for either guests 

or, like I said, packages or children.   

          DAVID MANFREDI:  Yeah, I'll just make -- all very 

good points -- the east side of the building, as you can see 

on the ground-floor plan, I believed then and still believe 

39

now is the appropriate place for access for parking and 

access for loading.   

          If you look at the plan, you can see that that 

really does occupy most of the frontage on the inside of the 

building, and we really did want retail to come out to the 

corner on Second and Thorndike, limiting the opportunity for 

other access on the inside of the building. 

          There is egress, there's a fire egress that 

egresses out the east side.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, as I said, I know it's 

very intimidating.  And if you just -- as you go forward and 

think about, think about, you know, if they were going to 

create ways to just make that situation a little bit easier.         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  If I could follow up on that?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Sure.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I believe every resident will be 

able to get into the resident bike room, and that door is on 

Second Street, up near the corner of Thorndike Street.  So 

you could --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay.    

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So you could walk in there, and 

walk down the corridor to the elevator.  And that's actually

a: inside in winter and b: is sort of a shorter distance.  

It's still a significant height.  Your apartment is back on 

the other side.   

          There's a fire stair on the right side of the 

building, which is right behind the loading dock, and 

management I think could set it up so that one could come 

into the door and get in the fire stair, where people have 

chosen to either walk up or perhaps more likely walk down.  

          It requires security, you know, card access.  It's 

not -- it's a little tricky, but I've certainly done that on 

projects that I've been involved in that had this kind of 

very large footprints.   

          I don't think it's simply me -- I think we should 

maybe put a condition in that that be studied --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  With the staff, to see if something 

like that is feasible.  The -- actually, I -- the distances 

are actually fairly astounding.  I mean, in one sense 

they're astounding.  Like, if you could sneak in, could go 

into the main lobby and sneak up the fire stair, you save 

430 feet if you were coming from the east. 

          Well, that's about a block or so.  I mean, you're

probably counting mini blocks, so maybe in context in your 

total journey it's not that significant, but if you're 

getting dropped off, and you've got some other things -- it 

would be a convenience, and I think it's -- should be -- see 

if it could be worked out.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Mm-hm.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

questions for the appliance?  Corrine?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I have a lot of questions, as 

always for staff and the applicant.  But first question for 

staff is am I missing a copy of the letter of commitment?  

I'm just wondering how we can make a decision about a final 

action without all the details of the community benefits 

laid out, as far as, like, what's legally enshrined?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So this isn't a 

zoning petition.  So there isn't a letter of commitment 

associated with it.  But the contract that they entered into 

with the city for the disposition of real estate to get the 

parking spaces has all of the details of the community 

benefits in the contract.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Did we get a copy of that, or  

--    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  When we recommended 

it, we had all of the summaries, and all of the details.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I wasn't at that hearing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  So that's been 

available.             

is where can I find them?    

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  All right.  So my next question 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Iram, do you know 

where that is currently available?            

          IRAM FAROOQ: So we will have a copy of that in the 

materials for that disposition on the Planning Board.  I can 

-- my computer just died, but Jeff will send you a link.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We certainly can.  It's a bit 

complicated and maybe they can fill in a little bit on the 

details, but when this came to the Planning Board, it was a 

proposal by the city to execute this disposition agreement.  

There were materials that were provided as part of that.  I 

think we have a webpage set up for it that I can set a link 

to. 

          And that included material from the current

applicant about what they were committing to do.   

          In the discussion at the City Council, there were 

additional commitments that were made kind of at the floor 

of the Council, and those would be executed as part of the 

final disposition of those parking spaces from the city to 

the -- it's a disposition of a lease of the parking spaces 

and the first retail space to the bidder in this case.   

          So it's sort of two separate processes working in 

parallel.  And I don't know if they want to fill in any 

information about just describing the commitments and the 

status of the lease agreement.   

          ROBERT DICKEY:  Rob Dickey with Leggat McCall.  So 

to answer that question, we --       

          THE REPORTER:  Could you spell --    

          ROBERT DICKEY:  Rob Dickey, R-o-b D-i-c-k-e-y with 

Leggat McCall Properties.  So the answer to that is that 

first of all the city, through the City Manager's office I 

believe, has an entire website on this that has all that 

information, including the bid that we made.   

          We were awarded -- we were the only bidder.  We 

were awarded the bid, and then we entered into a memo 

agreement with the city.  It forms the basis with the City 

44

Council where a final lease agreement is not finalized and 

executed, but it's in the process, and we hoped to get that 

done as soon as possible.  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks for the 

clarification.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay, thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I would just add there is a 

little bit of a chicken and egg into it, because the 

agreement was that -- part of the agreement was that they 

would do -- part of their commitment is to do what they're 

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yeah, it's just tricky for me 

because it's hard to weigh community benefits if we're just 

paying attention to a slide versus what the -- what's 

legally enshrined.  So that's why I'm asking the question. 

          So next question for staff is just with -- so 

saying what we're doing tonight in plain English, would you 

say that if I were to say that we're trading 150 parking 

spaces for 24 units of affordable housing that that's sort 

of what we're deciding tonight?   

          In other words, we're not making decisions about 

the project or about whether the project meets special

permit criteria, because that's already been decided, we're 

only making a decision about whether 150 parking spaces 

reduction and 24 units of affordable housing are something 

desirable, or something that meets special criteria.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Sure.  I'll just try to be quick on 

that.  So the -- in 2014, the Planning Board granted special 

permits for the project as a whole, which included the 

conversion of an existing structure to suit these new uses, 

as well as a project review special permit. 

          So the cases that the Planning Board typically 

reviews, where she it's a project of 50,000 square feet or 

more that undergoes review for urban design for 

transportation impacts, that's all has been granted.   

          So what this application is seeking is some more 

kind of specific relief on the parking to reduce the 

required number of parking spaces, and to convert an 

additional portion of the building from nonresidential use 

to residential use.   

          So it's really those two items which are special 

permits that in one case, work was not -- the special permit 

wasn't sought for the parking reduction, and in the other 

case, the relief was only granted the first time for the 

46

one, you know, chunk of 24 residential units.  And that 

needs to be increased to probably 48 residential units.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Could I just --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I think the one other thing 

that we are doing, which a couple of the public mentioned is 

that the original special permit did have a requirement of a 

certain number of both moderate or middle-income housing 

units, which the City Council chose not to support, and so 

we have to amend the special permit to eliminate the 

moderate or middle-income housing and make it all affordable 

housing.    

question.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep. Okay, on the 

same point, or --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It's a response to the parking 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So the First Street Garage has over 

1000 parking spaces perhaps.  It was built to serve the 

court hearing in several other buildings that are on the 

canal in the neighborhood.   

47

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

          So what's happened -- what will happen if we 

approve this is that the portion -- the number of spaces in 

the garage that are reserved for the office tenants will 

shrink significantly.  The garage will not shrink.  And any 

member of the public can go and park in the garage if the 

space is there.   

          And so, it's not like we're getting rid of -- you 

know, we're not demolishing or filling in empty spaces.  

We're changing the arrangement by which they're available, 

and we hope by doing that that PTDM measures will be more 

robust, and in fact the demand will go down, but the garage 

is a garage.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So another question for staff.   

I know for inclusionary zoning, and I understand this is not 

the inclusionary zoning, but I understand that for 

inclusionary zoning, CDD will pick units, which guarantees 

that all units that are created are equally well made and 

desirable.   

          Is there another example of a situation where a 

for-profit developer has agreed to 100% affordable units, 

and how did the city ensure that all of them are well-

constructed and maintained?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  There are a number of --            

          IRAM FAROOQ:  The city -- there have been 

instances where the city's affordable housing trust has 

funded a development of 100% affordable housing that has 

been done by a for-profit developer.   

          And just like with any other project, both through 

Design Review and through just ongoing work with our staff, 

we work to ensure that there's a higher quality of design.  

This is an instance where the project is in fact before the 

Board.   

          And so, in addition to the work that our staff 

does offline, there's also the opportunity in addition for 

the public and the Planning Board to weigh in and provide 

your appointments as well.   

          I think the last discussion was the discussion 

about entrances, was a good indicator of how things can get 

enriched through that discussion.             

          IRAM FAROOQ:  And just so that I can be really 

sure, can you define what "affordable" means in this 

context?  Is it that a renter would meet 80% of area median 

income?              

49

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

          IRAM FAROOQ:  So in this instance, it would be 80 

percent of area median income or less.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Can -- this is a question for 

staff -- what is the maximum number of people that are 

allowed to live in an affordable studio?                

          IRAM FAROOQ:  A studio?  Typically we have single 

folks who are taking up studios.  But there are occasionally 

instances where there might be a couple.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Is it allowable for, say a 

single parent with two children to rent a studio if they 

feel like that's enough space for them?                      

          IRAM FAROOQ:  I actually am not sure of the answer 

to that question.  I don't think it's true, but I don't want 

to definitively make that statement, because now we're 

getting really into the tenanting regs for inclusionary, and 

I think that I would direct the Board. 

          This is not going to -- I think the basic point is 

that this is not going to function any differently than how 

we manage our Inclusionary Housing portfolio overall.  So 

this is -- this will function the same -- in the same way as 

the inclusionary units do.   

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  I'm just concerned

that the number of studios, won't that be as valuable as 

other sized units, based on information we have about what 

kind of units are most sought after in the city?  So that 

was just me clarifying -- trying to learn how many people 

could live in the studio. 

          So I would say to the permitee that I think you 

have too many studios and not enough family-sized 

apartments.  I do have more questions. 

          Okay, so further questions for staff, the roof 

open space, would that be open to the public?  I believe 

there's open space on the roof of this building?  Maybe I 

read that incorrectly?  No?  Okay.  Thank you.   

          So question for staff, the units will be -- is it 

correct that the units will be rental units, and would they 

-- what would happen if this building were sold with these  

-- with the provisions for affordability -- would it be 

protected?           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Yeah, so the provisions for 

affordability are for the life of the building.  If the 

building changes from rental to condominium, then that same 

format carries through to the affordable units.   

          Now, I'm saying this because typically when we are

looking at inclusionary units, we are looking at a building 

that has market rate housing units as well.  So it's not 100 

percent clear to me how that might play out, if that were to 

transpire with this building. 

          If the owner -- I mean, I think that these are 

legal issues, which would have to be resolved with the 

city's Law Department at the time that such a provision was 

to come to pass.  But what I would say is that the -- excuse 

me, the Solicitor's office is very careful to protect the 

city's rights in this regard. 

          The one thing that I can say for certain is that 

the -- our covenants are strong, in that the affordability 

would not be lost, regardless of whether this was a resident 

-- sorry, a rental building or an ownership building in this 

context.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  My next question is 

about the $3.5 million-dollar donation to the affordable 

housing trust.  Is it correct that the current cost of 

creating the unit is -- it was mentioned in the presentation 

that it was a million dollars, but I've heard $500,000?   

          So I'm just wondering is it correct that $3.5 

million-dollar donation would equal about three affordable

units, or would it equal more?           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  So I'll say that one -- the cost of 

housing production varies in different contexts.  But we 

typically find that we are in closer to the $500,000 per 

unit.      

          And then if you think about how much the trust is 

putting into a unit, versus how much we are leveraging, we 

are often able to take the funds further in that regard. 

          The -- I would suggest that the matters of the 

contribution to the trust I believe are connected to the 

disposition, and not with this special permit.  So I would 

just question the Board in terms of how much you are 

spending in terms of thinking through provisions that are 

not before you at this point in time.           

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So you may suggest, then, that 

this is not relevant, but regarding that donation, it's said 

that that will be donated after 18 or at latest 18 months of 

occupancy.  And I wonder when that is expected to occur, 

understanding that construction is unpredictable, but in 

general would that be in 15 years from now, five years, one 

year?           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  I would bounce that question to the

proponent.     

          ROBERT DICKEY:  So there's two components of the 

affordable housing trust, given, and going by memory.  So 

there's a four and a half million-dollar contribution that's 

made as a part of the original bid that we made for parking.  

And then the Council vote in September, there was another 

$3.5 million that was added.    

          I know specifically that in the case of that $3.5 

million, it's applied to a Certificate of Occupancy on the 

building and 18 months after there's been payments made.   

          I believe the payment on the four and a half 

million is made at the certificate of occupancy, but I would 

need to check that out.  But that's all outlined in the bid 

documents.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So I -- many of my questions 

might be answered by this document.  I don't know if my 

request, then would be to continue the hearing for myself so 

that I can read this information, or --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well --            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  -- or if folks just want to 

accept that I don't have enough information to make a 

decision --  

54

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, I guess --            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  -- without a lot of questions 

or without seeing these documents?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, I think the 

question is, the commitment made as part of the disposition.  

I don't know that they're necessarily relevant to the 

special permits before us tonight.   

          And, you know, in terms of whether or not we -- 

you know, those would not be conditions of our special 

permit, and we -- unless people feel that we need those 

commitments in order to make the findings that we do, I 

would say that the applicants, or the application on its own 

does not suggest that those are necessary to make these 

findings, then I would suggest that we would -- unless other 

members of the Board feel strongly. 

          Otherwise, I think we have enough information to 

move forward without -- trying to avoid saying "litigating," 

sorry -- litigating the discussion that the City Council has 

already had in terms of what was the appropriate cost of 

providing the parking spaces that they are providing in the 

First Street Garage. 

          So if your questions are all relevant to that

contract and related to the disposition process, I think it 

probably does make sense to move on.            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So I'll ask one other question 

--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  -- which is in the documents it 

said that the City Council ordered the permitee to request a 

special permit to reduce the parking by 150 spaces.   

          And I wondered if staff could provide context 

about why City Council ordered that.  Was it more of a 

trade, so that we could 24 units of affordable housing, or 

was it because of another reason?             

          IRAM FAROOQ:  So just thinking back to the 

discussion at Council, the parking spaces that would be 

reduced are principally being introduced at the -- are 

reduced in terms of how many spaces the proponent is leasing 

from the city.  So it doesn't impact -- it's not impacting 

this building.  So the housing could have happened without 

the reduction in parking. 

          There wasn't a ton of discussion about this, 

except for the fact that we know that the more parking that 

is dedicated and allocated to the use, depending on how much

that user is charging the people who are driving to and from 

work, could in fact encourage more driving. 

          So part of the -- you know, part of the rationale 

from the Council was similar to our transportation demand 

management measures to reduce people driving to the site. 

          But I would say perhaps even more important was 

that they heard some concerns from neighbors that leasing 

too many of the spaces to the proponent might in fact limit 

the ability of neighbors who -- or users who come to other 

neighboring businesses to be able to find spaces in the 

garage. 

          While the city's analysis felt that that was not a 

significant issue, however, being able to remove those 

spaces from the lease would make them generally available, I 

think as Hugh said, not just to people who might be visiting 

this site, but who might be visiting other sites as well in 

the neighborhood.  So that was really the principal impetus.  

          I would say also that joe Barr, our Director or 

Traffic, Parking and Transportation is here, if that is 

something that the Board would want to get into further.  He 

has way more information on that than I.

          JOE BARR:  Good summary.                 

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  All right.  A couple questions 

for the permitee.  I'm wondering what -- how you would 

describe your good faith effort to lease childcare space.  

That means that you will post it for a certain number of 

days?  If it means that you're going to interview a certain 

number of potential lessors?  I would like to hear more 

about that. 

          And I would like to know if your intention is to 

facilitate low-cost childcare, or just to provide childcare 

on the site?  If it is to facilitate low-cost childcare, I 

would suggest that you use your power as a property owner to 

interview childcares that have a certain number of slots for 

EEC vouchers or for scholarships.   

          Otherwise, if you're charging rental rate, the 

market rate to a childcare, regardless of if they're non-

profit or for profit, the childcare will remain unaffordable 

to many people, and also where is the drop-off and pickup 

for childcare?     

          ROBERT DICKEY:  Those are good questions.  I'm 

going to start by saying that -- answering your last 

question first.  And that is that in terms of -- so if you 

58

see this entry here, it's dated -- we've already pointed out 

that the site has a high point here and a low point here.  

And the gray moves down into the hill here, and this is a --         

          BOARD MEMBER:  Excuse me, could you speak into the 

microphone?   

          ROBERT DICKEY:  I'm sorry.  So the childcare 

entrance is -- so the childcare entry is at that location, 

which is at grade, and provides a separate entry into that 

space.  And Thorndike, well, it was mentioned earlier, Third 

Street is definitely not a good street for drop-off.  Third 

Street is relatively quiet.  I mean Thorndike, I'm sorry. 

          And this area is considered to be a good location 

for morning drop-off and evening pickup.  So we're going to 

work with our Parking and Transportation around that and the 

details of the project. 

          So that’s the entrance to childcare.  This has 

also been vastly improved with the elimination of a corridor 

that came through the childcare.  So we've been able to make 

it bigger. 

          Going back to your first question, we have been in 

discussions with East End House really since the beginning 

of this project in 2013.  More recently, we -- and it was

around their needs around childcare and different levels of 

childcare --          

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Mm-hm.     

          ROBERT DICKEY:  -- and a desire to expand that 

program.  So we have a memo of understanding and agreement 

with them to explore them as a partner to operate this, and 

to work out the details of a program that works for them and 

works for us. 

          So we've been in discussions for a long time on 

that.  We've advanced those discussions in the last year 

after a hiatus on the project, and we have a -- our 

intention is to continue those discussions, and that's 

consistent with our obligations under the City Council. 

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  That's great.  They do a great 

job of providing the EC voucher slots.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other folks 

with questions, comments?  If not, we can -- oh, Steve.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I hate to belabor things when 

it's not necessary, but anyway, so I guess there are three 

changes that you've noted that I think are advantageous, and 

certainly improvable by this Board.   

          The third change if I understand it correctly is

the affordable housing.  This was -- I guess we just have 

lost the moderate-income housing.                  

          This was not your doing, but I feel the need to 

state as I frequently do, we've got this great advocacy in 

this city for affordable housing.  I think were doing a good 

job of providing affordable housing.  There was inadequate 

and virtually no advocacy for moderate income and housing.  

I really bemoan that loss.   

          I thought that we had achieved some affordable 

housing in this project, I'm sorry that we lost it; I'm 

sorry that City Council saw it in their infinite wisdom to 

lose that important asset to the city.  

          The city is evolving.  The day will come when this 

will be city for the wealthy and or the low-income, and it 

would be the middle-income people that will no longer have 

opportunities in the city.  It's a shame.  Other than that 

reminder detail, good changes, good project.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hm.  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Do you want comments?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.  I mean, all I wanted to 

say -- I mean, I agree with Steve.  I think the loss of the

moderate-income housing is unfortunate, but that was City 

Council's determination, and we've also heard reports from 

the housing authority of the housing trust that there isn't 

as great a demand for the moderate-income housing.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Some of us don't believe that.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, be that as it may, I 

bemoan its loss too, but I think this was a good project 

initially, and I think the City Council has ended up with a 

better project. 

          And I think while there may still be too many 

studio units, that there's been a reduction from the 

original special permit of studio units, and the increase in 

the three-bedroom going from the one-bedroom to 25 one-

bedrooms.     

          So I think as a whole, you know, what I think is a 

good project to begin with has become a much better project, 

and just a personal point of view, I really prefer the new 

fenestration of the podium to what it had been, but that's 

purely my aesthetics.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other comments?  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I guess I'll have to agree 

with a lot of the comments, all right, about access and so

forth.  I think you need to look at that a little closer.  

On the whole though, this has come so far.   

          And what people I think overlook is the real 

community benefit through use of this ugly, concrete, 

monolith as your architects -- it's been sitting in East 

Cambridge for 30 years.   

          If this moves forward, and I believe it should, it 

will transform it into a very handsome place to live and 

work.  I think all of your changes are beneficial, and I 

think we need it and we need it soon.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  I like the project very much.  I 

think the building design is beautiful.  I, I'm like Ted.  I 

prefer the original, but I understand that the change of use 

on those floors necessitates a change in the fenestration. I 

-- you know, I mean it's a minor change.  So, I mean, to me 

it's still just very, very, very lonely. 

          So I think yeah, I think this is going to be 

great.  The neighbors have waited a long time.  And I think, 

you know, even people who are not terribly supportive of the 

use are hopefully going to be quite happy that, you know, at 

least that ugly structure that was there will have changed,

and there will be a mix of uses again; much more affordable 

housing than was envisioned.   

          My only other comment on the parking -- I'm 

assuming the reason that you don't have all the residential 

parking in the building, the main building, is that you're 

trying to separate the residential from the office, and then 

you've got the bike parking too.   

          My only other suggestion on the parking and the 

city-owned garage is when you're leasing it, to me it should 

be the folks who are in the studios or whatever -- are 

people who are single and don't have kids that they're 

lugging, or elderly folks who may be renting. 

          You know, those folks you want to have them as 

close as possible to that elevator and garage.  So I don't 

know how you do that in terms of how you lease up the 

property, but if you at least consider that, it would be 

appreciated.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I wanted to just follow up on one 

point that Corinne made, and perhaps suggest that we add a 

condition for future review, which is the tenant fit out for 

the residential apartments.   

64

          In this building, the principal is the apartments 

are indistinguishable.  And so, I think there needs to be a 

certain amount of oversight that the quality level is 

somewhere into the quality of other affordable units that 

are in production.  But I don't know what those standards 

are. 

          We had one project where we wanted to put in stone 

countertops into affordable buildings like that; it was 

affordable, because the manager of the property -- he 

managed 20,000 or 30,000 units -- he said stone's fabulous 

because of glass.  And if you put in Formica, it gets beat 

up and has to be replaced.   

          We couldn't do it, because the Secretary of 

Housing of the Commonwealth had determined that stone 

countertops were too fancy for the affordable units, so they 

were wasteful of public subsidy funds.  So it will the 

difference between, you know, different ways of findings.   

          Anyway, I just, I think we may want to reassure 

ourselves that the standards these units are being built to 

is the appropriate standard.  But I don't think we can at 

this table specify that.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.  Okay.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Oh, I guess I should say of course 

I'm support this, because I actually signed the 2014 

decision.   

          I shared those hearings, and, you know, it's 

really important that this building be redeveloped, and the 

deal that is before us now is as good as we see.  And I 

believe the proponent has the ability to carry it out.   

          So I would like to see that.  And I wish -- Robert 

said, "Oh, yeah, we're going to open in three years."  I 

don't know how long it's going to take to do the remediation 

to reconstruction, but it's -- you know.     

          ROBERT DICKEY:  That's the goal.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Corinne, any further 

comments?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yeah.  I agree that the housing 

mix of units is better than the original 2014 version, but I 

don't think the mix of units is the right mix.  I think 

there should be more family-sized units. 

          Regarding parking, if my colleagues approve this 

special permit, I would ask you to consider whether there 

might be a condition that 48 of the parking spaces be 

allocated for the residences, rather than 24.

22

          And if folks don't think that should be a 

condition of the special permit, why not reach a 

gentleperson's agreement that residents can park in the 

office spots, which wouldn't be used at night?  It's 

confusing to me why residents wouldn't be able to park 

there.     

          And just to address a comment from a member of the 

public about process, I do think there's a lot of room for 

improvement in the Planning Board to make sure that the 

public understands what's happening, to make sure that 

members of the Planning Board have the data that they need 

to make decisions.   

          Sometimes materials are given to us literally at a 

meeting or before a meeting, which doesn't give us time to 

appropriately review them or to incorporate that data into 

our decision-making.   

          And I understand that I'm being told that 

community benefits are not part of my purview for tonight.  

I want to say for the public why I keep pushing on community 

benefits is that I understand $50 million dollars of 

community benefits sounds like a lot.   

          But when I do rough calculations, about 428,000

commercial square feet, using rental rates in 2015 which are 

much higher now, that using rental rates of $65 a square 

foot, that means that not counting residences, this 

development will get $27 million dollars per month in rental 

revenue, $333 million dollars per year in rental revenue.    

          So I want to make sure as a member of the 

community that the community gets what it deserves for the 

costs that gentrification imposes on the community.   

          Again, to that earlier comment by a member of the 

public, there is a cost to big buildings.  It increases 

housing prices, it increases other prices, it causes traffic 

and construction delays, it causes environmental issues, it 

causes infrastructure use on the community. 

          So I do think that it's not clear to the public 

when the public gets to participate in that decision-making 

about what community benefits the public deserves.  So I 

just want to make that comment in general.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Joe, can you 

come up and talk about shared-use parking, and how that 

could or wouldn't work here, why Traffic and Parking is 

comfortable with the 0.48 ratio for residences?     

          JOE BARR:  Sure.  I will try.

          JOE BARR:  So Joe Barr, Director of Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation, for the record.  So I guess in 

terms of the parking -- well, I guess I'll start with the 

residential parking ratio.   

          And I think, you know, based on -- and this is 

documented somewhat in, or is documented in a memo that VHB 

included, from VHB that's included in the application -- 

based on sort of what we've seen with residential in this 

general vicinity, as well as also with affordable housing, 

which tends to, just on average, have a lower parking ratio, 

or parking utilization than market-rate housing for a 

variety of reasons.   

          We feel like, you know, roughly 0.5, you know that 

it works out to 0.48 just because of some of the vagaries of 

how the City Council order was worded is appropriate.   

          And I think it's also appropriate to remember that 

a: all of these folks will be eligible for resident parking 

stickers, which are $25 a year, and they will also be 

eligible for -- say, if for some reason they decided to --  

          And I don't know, we haven’t really spoken with 

the applicant about what their plans are for charging for

parking, and it gets complicated, because there are certain 

rules that I'm not 100 percent familiar with about charging 

parking for affordable housing units. 

          But they're also eligible for the resident parking 

rate at our garage regardless, so that’s $100 a month, other 

than during the winter, when it drops to $50 a month. 

          So I don't anticipate -- I actually would be 

surprised if the 23 parking spaces that would be allocated 

for the residential units were actually used fully, just 

based on all the factors in play.   

          One conclusion of the parking study, which people 

can decide whether they agree with or not, but it is based 

on data, is that on the east side of Third Street, the 

parking is generally less used.                    

          And so, I think the opportunities for on-street 

parking for residents, particularly in the evenings, will be 

pretty open.  And if you go there and look at the meters in 

the evening, they're generally not particularly heavily 

used.   

          So for someone who's driving to work regularly, 

they should be able to use those, and even for those who 

aren’t, there's on-street resident permit parking that's, 

70

like I said, less heavily used than the parking that’s on 

the west side of Third Street. 

          And then in terms of shared parking, I mean, it's 

-- we haven't really evaluated this location.  And the 

proponent has not proposed that as an option.  I guess my 

concern would be -- and I think our general concern, 

particularly with residential, is that if we do not expect a 

lot of the people living there to be driving to work, then 

there may not in fact be that sort of tradeoff between -- 

you know, residential and office space.   

          And again, without a better understanding of -- or 

better analysis, which, like I said, was not done in this 

case, I'd be concerned about sort of making that 

recommendation just sort of standing here tonight. 

          Again, I think it's a small enough residential 

component, and there are enough other parking options in the 

sort of general vicinity that I'm not concerned.   

          I'm not particularly concerned that the 

residential will impose a particularly large burden, either 

on our garage, if that's where people choose to park on 

their parking facility, or on the surrounding streets.  Does 

that --

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That --    

          JOE BARR:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- it does.     

          JOE BARR:  All right.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.     

          JOE BARR:  You're welcome.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So in light of 

the comments we have received from everyone tonight, what 

I'm hearing is that there -- that the Board is generally 

prepared to make the necessary findings to grant the 

requested permits, with the condition that pedestrian access 

into the residential units -- particularly from the east, 

but that circulation be given careful consideration and 

worked on with staff throughout the design process. 

          And that -- I think we should express our -- the 

Board's lament about the loss of moderate-income units, 

moderate or middle-income units, but acknowledge that 48 

affordable units is still a desirable thing.  It's something 

that City Council has expressed as a matter of policy the 

city should be getting.

          Other conditions?  I would suggest on the parking 

that to the extent there end up needing to be operational 

changes with how the garage works or how the applicant 

interacts with the garage, that's certainly within the 

purview of Traffic and Parking, and is not something we need 

to describe at this time.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- I was just looking at 

Traffic and Parking's memo.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- which does, I think, include 

three additional TDM measures.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- to be included from the 

original special permit.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  These truly were just special  

-- and then, you know, also the ongoing review.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, no, I -- sorry, 

I didn't specify the conditions mentioned in staff memos 

should also be included.  Anything else?

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Hugh had proposed this 

condition about the -- some reference to affordable units 

being equivalent --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ah, yes, the --   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- to other affordable units.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  The oversight to 

enter the affordable housing units are of equivalent quality 

to others being produced in the area.  That -- okay?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I assume that's through a Design 

Review process as well?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Correct, yes.  That 

would not be the Board being involved in that.  That would 

be through CDD staff presumably; the Housing Division as 

well as the design staff, just as is done with inclusionary 

units.  Okay.  So Jeff, do we need to take -- can we take -- 

do this one vote, if we make all the findings?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  You can make the findings for 

the two special permits being requested, and then make one 

vote.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  So 

then the Board is moving forward with -- prepared to make 

the finding that the lesser amount of parking will not cause

excessive congestion in major public safety, substantially 

reduce parking availability for other uses, or otherwise 

adversely impact the neighborhood, or will provide positive 

environmental or other benefits to other users of the lot 

and the neighborhood, including assisting in the provision 

of affordable housing units.  Okay? 

          And conversion of nonresidential structures to 

residential use.  The increased number of dwelling units 

will not increase on-street parking demand in the 

neighborhood, which we've just heard Joe talk about in terms 

of there being a low likelihood of spillover demand here and 

the provision of space in the garage. 

          The location, orientation and use of the structure 

and yard, the new housing will not impact the privacy of 

residential neighbors.  To the extent the project goes 

forward, the overall environment and privacy of residential 

neighbors is likely to be enhanced.   

          Due consideration has been given to address the 

impacts of reduction in private open space.  Again, this 

doesn't reduce private open space.  And reasonable efforts 

have been taken to address concerns raised by abutters and 

neighbors.  And I think reasonable efforts is an appropriate 

75

finding for this situation.   

          And then we have the general special permit 

criteria.   

          So making those findings, and including the 

conditions that I previously outlined, do I have a motion 

from the Board to make the findings and grant the permits, 

as requested?                   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved.

          CAMILLE PRESTON:   All those in favor?  Opposed?

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you very much.   

          CAMILLE PRESTON:  Thank you.  We'll take a brief

                  Espinoza          

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We can 

come back into session.  A reminder that we are being audio 

and video recorded.  We'll move on to our -- the next matter 

of business, which is a design update from Cambridge 

Crossing.  So who will be speaking for you?  Please.    

          MARK JOHNSON:  All right.  Thank you for hearing 

our request tonight.  My name is Mark Johnson.  I'm Director 

of Development for DivcoWest.   

          And with me here tonight are Will Volgaris of 

NBBJ, the architect for Parcel H.; Robert Brown of Perkins 

and Will, the architect for Parcel G; Chris Matthews of 

Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates and the landscape 

architect for Parcels G and H; Anthony Gulluccio and Darren 

Baird from our legal team; and Nicole LaBossiere and John 

Rappaport from DivcoWest. 

          We're also pleased to be joined this evening by 

facilities personnel from Sanofi. 

          So Sanofi has leased Parcels G and H in order to 

create a comprehensive campus for both lab and office at one 

location.  And this has enabled Sanofi to concentrate its

lab research in Parcel G, and office support functions as 

that would normally accompany labs in Parcel H.   

          Sanofi also chose Cambridge Crossing for the 

vitality of the mixed-use environment we're creating.  And 

as you'll see in the presentation tonight, the company is 

proposing to make additional investments in ground-floor 

activation.  We believe that's going to further contribute 

to the dynamic place we're creating at Cambridge Crossing.   

          Sanofi, including its predecessor Genzyme, has 

been in Cambridge for over 30 years, and has worked to 

support the community in many ways.  And that includes 

community volunteerism and engagement in areas of science 

education, health, and access to health care, as well as 

unmet community needs. 

          Sanofi has a history of building sustainable 

partnerships with local community programs, and I just want 

to read a few of them.  The Fletcher-Maynard Academy Reading 

Buddies program, Just-A-Start biomedical careers program, 

the Science Club for Girls, the Dimmock Center. And they 

have a 21-year relationship with the East End House. 

          Sanofi has hired a number of graduates from the 

biomedical career program, and they're also working to

utilize the Job Connector by MIT to market job opportunities 

for residents.   

          So we've been working closely with Sanofi to 

prepare Buildings G and H for occupancy.  And in the course 

of designing their laboratories and office, it's been 

necessary to request a few modifications to the exterior of 

the buildings that we believe are minor, but are nonetheless 

essential to support Sanofi's research activities. 

          So we're here tonight to present the proposed 

revisions to the Design Review approval that the Board 

granted in 2019.  And these revisions fall into two 

categories; first, the ground-floor and public realm 

activation, and secondly the changes necessary to support 

critical research.  And I'm going to speak briefly about 

each category. 

          As I've mentioned, one of the things that 

attracted Sanofi to Cambridge Crossing was the quality of 

the public realm being built there, including the retail and 

open spaces.   

          And we're very pleased that Sanofi would like to 

contribute further to the activation of the site by 

expanding their building lobbies and adding more retail.

And we think we that these changes contribute significantly 

to the public realm around Parcels G and H.   

          The other changes are proposed to allow Sanofi to 

carry out critical research activities.  And they include, 

just to cite a few examples, the addition of exterior 

roofers, two more bays at the loading dock, and screened 

equipment near the loading dock. 

          And we're going to show each of these to you this 

evening.    

          MARK JOHNSON:  All right.  So the other changes 

that are proposed to allow Sanofi to carry out its research 

activities -- and these include, to cite a few examples, the 

addition of exterior louvers, two more bays at the loading 

dock, and screened equipment near the loading dock. 

          And we're going to show each of these changes to 

you this evening, and all that are required for Sanofi to 

carry out its scientific research and office operations at 

Cambridge Crossing. 

          While we're seeking approval for these changes in 

Cambridge, we are also reviewing them with city staff in 

Boston.  You may recall that Parcels G and H straddle the 

municipal boundary between Cambridge and Boston.  Boston has

been supportive and helpful, and we expect to conclude that 

process soon.   

          And then before appearing before you tonight, we 

met with Cambridge City staff to review these proposed 

changes.  Staff has weighed in and we have responded, and we 

thank Suzannah and others at City staff for their input. 

          I wish to note that when the Board approved the 

designs of Parcels G and His in 2019, the Board asked us to 

work with staff on a few remaining design refinements.  And 

you may recall the list, it included such things as the 

color of the canopy over the entrance of Parcel H.   

          And we've concluded that continuing a review 

process with staff and those changes have been incorporated 

in what you're going to see tonight.  Apart from those 

continuing review items, the designs are unchanged from what 

the Board approved in 2019.   

          And then before reviewing the proposed changes, 

I'd also like to provide a brief update on Cambridge 

Crossing. 

          So this spring, we're going to complete 

construction of the shared retail building on Parcel W, as 

well as the Common.  And it's shown in the photo here.  On

the right, you can see the Parcel J, K Lab building, which 

has just been completed, and is now occupied by its anchor 

tenant, Philips.   

          And beyond the shed, you can see construction is 

proceeding on the Parcel I residential building. 

          To the left, beyond this view, construction is 

underway on the Parcel Q1 retail and office building, which 

also contains the Cambridge Crossing Bicycle Center.   

          And then off to the left from this view, 

construction is also proceeding on the MBTA Green Line 

Extension.   

          And we have completed construction of the Baldwin 

open space adjacent to Parcel J, K. And the park is now open 

to the public.  This slide is a shot of one of the planting 

beds involved when taken from above a little while ago.   

          We believe that the network of open spaces, 

including the Common and Baldwin open space, coupled with 

the public amenities we are providing, such as the retail, 

the public toilets, the bicycle center, are all going to 

make Cambridge Crossing a popular destination for residents 

of Cambridge.

the architects, I want to thank the Board for its role in 

making Cambridge Crossing a success.  Your guidance has 

helped us at every step of the way.   

          The Board recalls all the challenges we had, 

particularly on Parcels G and H.  These parcels straddle a 

municipal boundary.  They border a rail yard.  They're 

impacted by the Gilmore Bridge.  They were cut off from the 

balance of East Cambridge by the O'Brien Highway, and they 

were plagued with the uncertainty as to whether the Green 

Line Extension would ever be built. 

          And we've come a long way to where we are today, 

with several buildings under construction and several more 

in design.  So I just want to thank the Board for that. 

          So with that, I'll turn it over to Will Volgaris 

of NBBJ, and he's going to talk about Parcel H.   

          WILL VOLGARIS:  So we'll do Parcel H, then 

followed by Parcel G. As Mark mentioned, the two drivers 

behind the minor changes are the ground-floor activation, 

and the use, and we'll get into that a little more 

specifically. 

          On the ground-floor activation, we're showing an 

expanded lobby at the upper level of the lobby, the level 

83

that’s at the top of the Murphy stair terrace of the Gilmore 

Bridge level, and we've also added some retail function into 

that lobby.  There was already some retail function in the 

lower portion of the lobby at the bottom of the Murphy 

stairs. 

          For the tenant uses, we've relocated a couple of 

doors, exterior doors on the terrace.  That's the north of 

the building.  We've added an exterior door on the Gilmore 

Bridge side, simply as a means of egress.   

          And then we have some louvers and couple of other 

parts of the façade that are just requirements for some 

mechanical rooms inside. 

          And then there's also the use of a little more 

shadow box, which was the approved detail in the project 

originally. 

          So this is the lobby level.  This was the upper 

lobby, and then you're coming down the Gilmore Bridge.  This 

is where the Murphy stairs are.  This is the upper portion 

of the lobby, and then you descend in the lobby down to the 

lower portion. 

          This has now been expanded.  I think, again, a 

more active use, it's essentially doubled in size, and

Sanofi is including another retail location -- probably 

something like a coffee shop. 

          And then the actual program use of the space is 

intended to be for tenant wellness, so an active use on the 

ground-floor -- I think when we originally presented this.  

I wasn't sure if there might be office use on the ground-

floor, but now we're going to have an active use. 

          And then these are renderings that we had shown 

originally.  So this was in our original proposal.  The 

approved rendering in here, we're simply showing that the 

use inside is no longer a business use, but again, something 

more active -- tenant wellness.   

          And also, as Mark had mentioned, we're showing the 

slight change in -- or the change in color.  This was the 

red railing that -- actually it matches the canopy, which 

here is red, and now we're using -- we have finally arrived 

at yellow for that.  And we've been working with staff to 

arrive at that. 

          I had mentioned a couple of doors.  Actually, two 

of the doors that -- they're not actually added, they're 

just changed in location.  There are always two doors out 

onto the terrace.  This is a roof terrace.  This has been a

greenscape. 

          And then there's a new door being added.  This is 

-- because of the program uses inside, we need another 

egress.  That would be egress only; it's not an entrance 

door.  It would simply be for egress. 

          And then, again, views -- this is from the Gilmore 

Bridge, crossing the Gilmore Bridge.  This is simply the new 

added egress door -- again, egress only, not an entry point, 

and the revised color for the railing.   

          We had mentioned that there were a couple of 

changes on the exterior skin that related to louvers and 

mechanical spaces.   

          So there's a mechanical room that's driven by -- 

so we want to make sure we're keeping mechanical support -- 

we're not enlarging the rooftop at all.  We've tried to keep 

more mechanicals off of the rooftop to change the profile of 

the roof.   

          So this is at the third floor.  This area will 

have louvers, and if you remember just the composition of 

the building with sort of a base level, and then the upper 

portions, the louvers fit nicely into the base band of the

building, and that is really, then the only change there. 

          On the ninth floor, similarly, there's a 

mechanical space on the ninth floor that also needs louvers.  

We are putting louvers on the west side of the building.  

That's the most obscured side of the building.  And we're 

just blocking out visibility of the mechanical space with a 

shadow box, where there were once transparent windows.   

          The shadow box is -- again, the approved detail 

for the skin, that's really just to prevent transparency and 

seeing mechanical equipment in the building.   

          And here, it's really hard to see in the rendering 

of course, because it's simply a shadow box, it's glazed, 

but in this enlarged view, it may be a little bit easier to 

understand.  So this is facing north.  This is where we've 

filled in shadow box.   

          Again, same system as what's been approved and 

what's mocked up out there.  And then we've added louvers on 

the west side.  Again, this is facing Parcel G. So not 

really visible too much. 

          And that is it for changes to Parcel H.  I don't 

know if we want to do questions on H, or if we want to just 

keep going through Parcel G.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Why don't we do 

questions?  Oh, what do Board members think?  Do we have 

actual questions, or do you want to do discussion later?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I have a question.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Question.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I just want to be clear.  So 

you're not adding more mechanicals, you're just putting them 

in different locations?   

          WILL VOLGARIS:  No, there are mechanical systems 

for the program inside the building.  So, you know, an air  

-- like a small air handler unit or a pump.  And we're not 

putting it up on the roof.  Instead, we're putting it into 

the floor plan.      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And the additional mechanicals 

are a result of your tenant --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah, exactly.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you.     

          ROBERT BROWN:  Thank you.  I'm Robert Brown.  I'm 

the managing Director for Perkins and Will and working on 

Parcel G.  Similar to Will's presentation, we will show you 

before and afters of each of the slight modifications that

have been made going forward.   

          The same way there's ground-floor activation that 

is happening, and then there are certain tenant requirements 

that have come forward, as we understand more clearly what 

the science and activities are, so.   

          On the ground-floor, similar to H is that the 

lobby is expanding.  So this shows the approved lobby entry 

vestibule.  There's a fire command station, open seating, a 

desk.     And you'll see all those components existing, and 

they are adding sort of breakout area that is connected to 

the science on display, as well as this greater -- they just 

have a greater need for visitors that are coming in that 

will be working that space. 

          But the perimeter is still the same.  We have the 

doors and glass connection to the park.  The entry space is 

exactly the same.  And you'll see just in a second that 

actually the visibility is a little bit challenging to see 

the difference, but here we are.  Those two perspectives 

that we had shown.   

          This was approved, and here we are, and you can 

just see a little bit deeper into the space.  So on the 

outside, there's a little bit more glass, a little more

activity going forward. 

          This also has all the landscape removed just for a 

second, and then the next rendering shows that area with the 

landscape, a little bit more of a dusk shot, so there's 

still a lovely landscape that Chris has, the original, and 

then the approved piece.  And all of a sudden, there's a 

column that’s there.  There's really some exciting 

opportunities for display and activity in that space.   

          Probably the biggest change really ends up being 

with regard to the service.  And I'd like to have Chris talk 

about --  

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Thanks.  So we -- Chris Matthews 

with Michael van Valkenburgh Associates.  We had a series of 

good conversations with Suzannah and her team around the 

service drive, which is, as you'll remember from the last 

plan, there's a series of private service drives that come 

off of Door Street.   

          So the service drive works for both Building H and 

Building G, and access to the parking garages of both 

buildings, and the service docks of both buildings. 

          You'll hear from Robert about the increased 

capacity that Building G needs in terms of service, but as

far as the public realm and the landscape is concerned, we 

have relocated some of the trees on the west side of the 

service drive over to the Building H side.   

          There's still the same amount of trees.  There's 

the food truck, and sort of eating plaza, if you remember on 

the southeast corner, which we believe is still fairly well-

screened from the back of house areas. 

          We made a small adjustment to put the sidewalk 

connection in board of the trees, so the trees on either 

side of the service drive, like nick that down a little bit.  

But quite frankly, we don't expect and we don't really want 

the general public to be wandering around back there.  You 

know, the public realm is in the front there. 

          In addition, we had a service yard, which in the 

approved scheme was not entirely articulated, but with 

Sanofi's program needs understood, and they have a series of 

tanks, which you've probably seen around Kendall Square.  I 

don't know what they have inside them.   

          But what they will have around them now is a low 

wall, and then a planted vine screen up above it.  So that's 

really the change in the landscape. 

          And we added striping down the driveway on the

request of Traffic and Parking.     

          ROBERT BROWN:  Thanks, Chris.  So if you look at 

those two areas, we also -- so here's what the approved 

scheme was.  That's where the loading dock was.  And in 

fact, some vaults were visible.   

          Now if we look at that same elevation, there's an 

additional dock bay here, and this is the screening of the 

tanks that you'll see in a second on a perspective sketch.   

          And so, now we're looking down that edge.  This 

shows the trees.  There's the sort of one tree that’s gone 

to the other side.  There's the loading dock as it is right 

now.      And really, here's this change.  The service yard 

we knew was there.  We didn't know what was in it or what 

needed to be done.  We're screening at the base with precast 

components, somewhat similar to the building itself. 

          And then there are two tanks that they're going to 

be sort of neutral color.  There's not going to be stickers 

and other things that are on there.  So it really sort of 

blends into that landscape piece, hopefully.   

          The other side, and similar to H, is that there 

are greater needs for air.  Come in and come out, and that 

is not something that we also want to do on the roof, 

92

because the roof is quite full.   

          So the previous scheme we did not have louvers on 

the exterior component of the building, but now we are -- we 

have not changed the amount of glazing that's there.  You 

can see that the precast has a little bit less in turn.  But 

we've stacked those up, and they are existing on each of the 

floors going into the mechanical spaces for ingress and 

egress. 

          And so, this shows it a little more closely.  This 

was the existing, this was that larger piece of precast that 

was turned.  Here the louvers are sitting within that same 

band of glazing, which we think is -- you know, disguises 

itself.  I just put one in and so, all of a sudden, it 

becomes a little bit obvious. 

          Interestingly enough, the last conversation we had 

was visibility to any of the mechanical spaces, and there is 

a piece of equipment that has to be put on the roof, and it 

is a little bit higher than the other equipment.  So we are 

raising the roof 4 foot 6 on that corner.  So here's where 

we were before.  If you follow that sort of gray band that 

now goes all the way through.  

          But what is really the result of that, and you had

12

13

22

to do some pretty thorough analysis, was this was the 

previous site use.  We went into public locations to see how 

close would it be before we saw a piece of equipment, and it 

was over 1,800 feet in most cases, 1,200 to 1,800 feet.   

          And in the new position, we're beyond that.  So 

there -- it really is not visible from these locations going 

forward, and its absolutely imperceptible from that side.  

But that roof did raise four feet, which is about, you know, 

that high to protect the open piece. 

          And I think that's what we're at.  So any 

questions?  We'll take --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Questions on this 

building?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I have a quick.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  On the service lot, is there 

any reason why you can't completely screen the tanks?    

          WILL VOLGARIS:  Oh, you can do that?  Okay.  So we 

did study that.  And we studied bringing the same precast 

material up to the height of the tanks.  And we actually 

felt that that made it too noticeable and too bid.  Let me 

just pull up that perspective.

          So we did have a similar thought.  So I'm going to 

show it.  We actually thought painting the tanks kind of a 

neutral gray color, including the landscaping around tree 

canopy height was actually the best way to handle it.  So 

we're open to other ways of approaching it, but that's -- we 

do want you to know that was a result of study.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It's just they always stick 

out, they always -- especially from the ridge view.     

          ROBERT OR WILL:  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I don't know, slab wall.  

Tall, green something?  It seems like we could do a better 

job than just to -- I don't know, what's that, about eight 

feet maybe?     

          WILL VOLGARIS:  I don't know the dimension, but we 

can find it out.  I think it's about eight feet.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And they're going to be 

considerably taller.     

          WILL VOLGARIS:  Mm-hm.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And just, they always look 

half done.     

          WILL VOLGARIS:  I hear you.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Always looked like somebody 

95

put the fence up, and what they were trying to screen was 

double height that they thought it was.  I just -- it's just 

always a sticky spot.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions?  

Hugh?           

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Comment, the add-in maneuvers there 

I saw someplace that you were going to try to get them in 

the tone of precast, rather than the tone of the windows.  

And I would applaud this, although I note the louvers are in 

the City of Boston.            

          COLLECTIVE:  [Laughter]    

          WILL VOLGARIS:  So you would prefer the tone of 

the windows, is that correct?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  No, to the precast.     

          WILL VOLGARIS:  Tone of the precast, okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  The renderings --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  The renderings showing louvers are 

always hard.  I mean, here it looks like they're in the tone 

of the windows.  In the other direction, it looked like 

you've achieved that.   

          I think the intention is correct, and I'm sure

Suzannah will be out there at the mockups.  And I'll 

probably be standing next to her, lost. 

          Well, the mockups would be in Cambridge.  Are we 

going to need somebody?             

          COLLECTIVE:  [Laughter]     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

comments?  Yep, Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I just wanted to ask if 

Suzannah had any comments she wanted to add?   

          SUZANNAH BIGOLIN:  Thank you.  We're generally 

supportive of the changes, and we think in a lot of cases, 

there are improvements with the expanded lobby, the retail, 

the changes to H at the Gilmore Bridge are more activating, 

which is good. 

          We wanted the Board to see the expanded loading 

areas.  Generally, that's not something we like to see, but 

we understand the tenant needs, and there's -- the trees 

will help mitigate the loading in the service yard, and the 

extension of the corners and windows above also helps kind 

of make it feel less backhouse. 

          With H, we also wanted to know the office terrace 

on the south side of the building is proposed to change from

mostly a green space to hardscape.  We would have preferred 

to see a green roof for environmental reasons, but we 

understand there's overshadowing issues with the 

landscaping. 

          And we also wanted to point out the wayfinding 

color is yellow now, which we think is an improvement from 

the red, and more cheery and welcoming, but happy to take 

comments from the Board on that.  But overall supportive of 

the changes.  Thank you.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  So I was concerned about 

the hardscape in the terrace on H.  So what is the issue of 

the agreement?   

explain that.    

          SUZANNAH BIGOLIN:  The applicant can probably 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          WILL VOLGARIS:  So the terrace -- let me pull up 

an image of that.  So the tenant is going to finish the 

terrace, and this is on the north side of the building 

facing the rail yard.  It's also in shadow.   

          We did have some discussions around heat island 

effect.  We would normally not very a hardscape terrace in 

this climate because of heat island effect, but because the

terrace is so well shaded on the north side of the building, 

that isn't an issue. 

          And on the other side, Sanofi does desire to have 

more hardscape just for the flexibility of use.  It would be 

loose tables and chairs and planters.  The planters are not 

really depicted in in the plan as well as they should be, 

but they are -- it is vegetated, but the plant beds are not 

fixed, they are movable planters.      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And I knew it.  I guess the 

terrace is in Boston also.          

          COLLECTIVE:  [Laughter]    

          WILL VOLGARIS:  The terrace is in Boston, that is 

correct.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Next?       

          MARY FLYNN:  So to get to Suzannah's comment on 

the yellow, I think you're right.  It is cheerier.  So I 

prefer it to the red, but I still have a problem with this 

railing up on the bridge.  I think the last time you were 

looking at it, I said it reminded me of caution tape, you 

know?  Because it was -- I think it's the flat narrowness of 

it.  And so, now that it's yellow, I really think of it as, 

like, police tape, or caution tape.

          So I mean maybe it's -- maybe in reality it will 

look fine, but that's just -- that’s a concern I have, and I 

don't know whether maybe changing it from sort of a flat 

surface to something that's rounded a little bit would just 

make it seem a little less severe, or I don't know.  But 

again, that's kind of a really nitpicky detail, so.     

          WILL VOLGARIS:  Well, we're happy to entertain 

other colors.  I think the renderings do make it look a 

little flat.  In fact, there would be a round railing with  

--      

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay.     

          WILL VOLGARIS:  -- with supports that are three-

dimensional.  So it does kind of paste out a little bit in 

the rendering, kind of flatten out.  But I think, you know, 

I mean we're happy to work with staff on that.   

          I think we went through an exhaustive process, and 

members of the team were smiling around all the colors we 

did evaluate for this.              

          ANTHONY GULLUCCIO:  And actually Chris's jackets 

when we started the permitting were red.  He switched to 

yellow, and we all had --           

          COLLECTIVE:  [Laughter]                  

100

          ANTHONY GULLUCCIO:  Yeah.  So anyway, we believe 

yellow is the best color, and we're --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  I don't have a problem with 

the color, it's the image, really.  I mean, but as you're 

saying, it's just the way it's showing.  So if there is a 

curve to it, in reality it's going to look different.  So 

that will address my concern.                 

          ANTHONY GULLUCCIO:  Agreed, agreed.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other permits?  

Questions?  Is the Board ready to approve the design changes 

for both buildings, subject to any changes being further 

discussed with staff?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Does 

someone want to make a motion to that effect?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So moved.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   All those in 

favor?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Anything else?         

          ANTHONY GULLUCCIO:  No, I -- and just to confirm 

the issues for staff, or really the height of the green 

screen, the tone of the louvers at precast, and making sure 

that it's a three-dimensional round railing.  Those are the 

three big issues.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's right.         

          ANTHONY GULLUCCIO:  Awesome.  Thank you very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  I believe 

-- just let me check with staff.  I believe that concludes 

our business for the evening.  Jeff, is that correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I don't have anything.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Iram, we're good?     

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Then we are 

adjourned.  Thank you all very much.
