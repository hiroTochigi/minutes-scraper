          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY: Good evening, and 

welcome to the September 8, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board. My name is Catherine Preston Connolly and I 

am the Chair.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charlie Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on July 

30, 2020.  

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within 

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will then give 

instructions for public comment at that time, and you can 

also find instructions on the city's webpage for remote 

Planning Board meetings.  

          I will start by asking the Staff to take Board 

member attendance and verify that all members are audible.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, this is Jeff Roberts 

from Community Development.  I'm just going to ask each 

Planning Board member who's present, if you are present and 

if meeting is audible to you.    

          Louis Bacci, are you present and is the meeting 

audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Present and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  H Theodore Cohen, 

are you present and is the meeting audible to you?

you present, is the meeting audible to you?         

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Present, and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Steve.  Hugh Russell, 

are you present, is the meeting audible to you?   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Present, and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Hugh.  Tom Sieniewicz, 

are you present and is the meeting audible to you?  

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I am present, and the meeting is 

audible to me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Tom.  Corinne Espinoza, 

are you present, and is the meeting audible to you?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I'm present, and the meeting is 

audible to me.       

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Corinne.  And Catherine 

Preston Connolly is chairing the meeting.  Can you just 

verify the meeting is audible to you?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It is audible to me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Catherine.  I'll just 

indicate Mary Flynn and Nikolas Bowie indicated to me and to 

staff before the meeting they would not be in attendance.  

If either of those members are in attendance, please say so 

6

now.                 

          [Pause]  

          Those 2 members are marked as absent, so there are 

seven members present; that's six full members and one 

Associate.  I'll turn it back over to the Chair.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you Jeff.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  The first item is an 

Update from Community Development Department.  Please 

introduce the staff who are present at the meeting and give 

the update?  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff Roberts, again.  I'm 

going to assume it's me doing the update this time.  And 

staff that are present within the Zoning and Development 

Division and Community Development Department, my staff:

this evening; also Liza Paden, and later in the meeting 

Daniel Messplay and Sarah Scott will be joining us. 

          Also from Community Development, Erik Thorkildsen 

in our Community Planning Division with Urban Design; Khalil 

Mogassabi, the Deputy Director of Community Development and 

Chief Planner; and the Assistant City Manager for Community 

Development, Iram Farooq, is present.   

          And Iram, was there anything that you wanted to 

say at this time, or should I just go into the updates?      

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Please keep going Jeff, you're fine, 

thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  We didn't rehearse this 

before.  From the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department, also Adam Shulman is present at the meeting.   

          So shifting to updates, just a quick look at the 

Planning Board calendar and assigned things going forward.  

Tonight, we have two public hearings; one on a special 

permit case and another on a zoning petition, which we'll be 

getting to.   

          We have on September 15 a public hearing scheduled 

on the Canal District Kendall PUD District Zoning Petition.  

So this is a petition to create a new Planning and

Development zoning district.  It's by Biomed Realty, 

property owner in that area. 

          We also have an item of General Business scheduled 

for next week.  This is an update on a Planning Board case 

that has been with the Board for quite a long time.  It's 

1991 and 2013 Mass Ave, also known as the St. James Church, 

and there will be an update on that at that time.   

          September 22, we have a public hearing scheduled 

on another zoning petition.  It is called the Donovan et 

al., or Donovan and others Zoning Petition.  This zoning 

petition deals with changes to use and dimensional 

requirements in the Residence A1 and A2 Zoning Districts of 

the city. 

          And we don't have any hearings scheduled for 

September 29.  We hope to take another little break at that 

point, and at this point October 6, we have a public hearing 

scheduled.      

          It is the first public hearing for the 

Cambridgeside Planned Unit Development proposal.  This was 

based on the zoning that was adopted by the Council last 

year, and now coming forward for Development Review. 

          I noted at the last meeting, that at this time we 

9

don't have an update on Ordinance Committee hearing 

scheduled for the zoning petitions that I just mentioned and 

we still don't.  But by next week, perhaps we'll know and 

I'll give the Board an update at that time. 

          Thanks, and that's it for me.  I'll turn it back 

over to the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  If 

there are any questions from Board members, please say your 

name and ask your question.  No? All right. 

                         * * * * *

Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, Louis J.

                  Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, 

                  Corinne Espinoza   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right, then the 

next item is Approval of Meeting Minutes.  The Board has 

received certified transcripts for meetings held on July 21, 

August 4, August 11, and August 18, 2020.  If there are any 

questions from the Board, please say your name and pose your 

question.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Steve 

moved, and Louie seconded.  Roll call vote.

                  Corinne Espinoza   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Then we'll move on to 

the next item ongoing agenda, which is a public hearing on 

Planning Board Special Permit Case PB #366, an application 

by Nuestra LLC to convert an existing space at 200 Monsignor 

O'Brien Highway into a cannabis retail store. 

          CDD Staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  This is an application 

for a cannabis retail store.  They -- as the Planning Board 

members are probably aware -- are allowed in this district, 

but they require a special permit from the Planning Board,

per the requirements in Section 11.800 of the zoning 

          And this applicant meets the separation 

requirements, so there are requirements for separation of 

ordinance. 

stores.   

          And this is the one -- I guess peculiar thing 

about this application is that it may seem somewhat familiar 

to the Planning Board, because there was an application that 

the Planning Board reviewed and approved at some point in 

the past for a medical marijuana establishment at this 

location.   

          This is not the same applicant or the same 

application, this is a different applicant proposing a 

cannabis retail store, which is not medical. 

          And I believe the group that is presenting is led 

by Rebecca Rutenberg.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So then 

we will turn it over to the applicant.  Rebecca, you are 

presenting on behalf of the applicant, is that correct?     

          REBECCA RUTENBERG:  Absolutely, yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Then 

you'll have up to 30 minutes for the presentation, although

we hope you can be as concise as possible.  Please begin by 

introducing your project.     

          REBECCA RUTENBERG:  Absolutely.  So my name is 

Becca Rutenberg.  I'm here with Vicente Sederberg, LLP on 

behalf of Nuestra LLC, which is seeking to operate a 

cannabis retail store, as Jeff just mentioned, at 200 

Monsignor O'Brien Highway. 

          And before we get started, I'd just like to 

introduce the project team.  We're joined this evening -- I 

think perhaps in the same video screen, if you're watching 

along, by Ivelisse Rivera, who's the Chief Executive Officer 

of the team; as well as Renata Caines, who is the Chief 

Engagement Officer; Jonathan Tucker, who is the Chief 

Operating Officer.   

          I love pet cameos, excellent; Tony Capachietti 

from Hayes Engineering, who is the Civil Engineer on the 

project; as well as Brandon Kurtzman, one of the Managing 

Partners are Vicente Sederberg.  Do not let his name fool 

you in the video.  He is not Adam Fines, as he was listed.  

          So before I move on, just wanted to take a moment 

to thank the Board, as well as CDD staff, you know, for just 

their diligence in working kind of through this unusual time

-- you know, for all kind of public meetings.  We are 

appreciative of kind of the swift nature this Board has 

taken moving applicant through the process throughout the 

summer. 

          And Swaathi, I am ready for that next slide 

whenever you're ready.       

          Perfect.  And Jeff mentioned this applicant -- 

application, rather -- might seem a bit familiar.  You know, 

in the time when we were still allowed to go out in 

restaurants, when we weren’t wearing masks, we presented -- 

my office presented before this Board for a different 

applicant; Ascend Mass LLC, which was seeking a Planning 

Board Special permit to operate a registered marijuana 

dispensary at the site. 

          They were successful, and they were ultimately 

also successful in going before the Board of Zoning Appeals 

for a special permit relevant to some existing nonconforming 

parking at the site.   

          And after both of those permits were obtained, the 

Cambridge City Council passes the Cannabis Business 

Permitting Ordinance, which set -- as this Board well knows, 

you know, standards in place as to the types of applicants 

15

that were eligible to apply for adult use. 

          So Ascend Mass LLC is no longer pursuing its 

proposal at the site, and Nuestra LLC has taken site control 

of the property, and will be moving forward. 

          Nuestra has no affiliation with Ascend Mass LLC 

which I think was a bit confusing for some folks in the 

community, so just to be abundantly clear:  No affiliation 

with Ascend Mass LLC, and is only controlled by Cannabis 

Control Commission certified Economic Empowerment 

applicants.   

          However, the plans may look familiar.  As you 

know, CDD staff and this Board spent considerable time kind 

of tweaking the plans and really working to make the 

exterior and interior [34:21 audio unclear] with the Urban 

design objectives of the city.  So it may look familiar, but 

there have been some slight changes. 

          Ready for the next slide.  Excellent. 

          So as I mentioned, Nuestra is a locally owned and 

operated team that is seeking to operate as an Economic 

Empowerment applicant, as well as a women business 

enterprise.  They are a locally based team -- you know 

Ivelisse and Renata live within about 15 minutes of the

site, and are deeply involved in each of their local 

communities, although I won't go on with their particular 

resumes.   

          But candidly, they are the type of applicants that 

being more in the position of the Board at this point, 

really working with communities and development 

opportunities to make sure they are in coordination with the 

neighborhood.  So this is a wonderful opportunity for them 

to sort of show an application that would test the standards 

that they would expect in their own community. 

          Ready for the next slide? 

          And as any good team does, they are certainly 

backed by a team of experts in addition to Vincente 

Sederberg, which is the firm that I am from.  They have a 

variety of cannabis experts -- [35:26 indiscernible proper 

name] who was also on the past application at this site, 

formerly of the Boston Police Department, and a variety of 

local sort of, you know, event execution and cannabis 

veterans who are very equipped to assist them in this 

venture. 

          Ready for the next slide?   

          And so, we're certainly all familiar with the

site, which is what I would say is a bit of a landmark 

separating the city, just because most people are so 

familiar with it as the Lechmere.   

          So just to kind of set the standards for the 

presentation, they are seeking to operate a cannabis retail 

store within the existing structure and the existing parking 

lot at 200 Monsignor O'Brien Highway, which is located 

within the Business A zone -- as Jeff mentioned, it allows 

cannabis retail stores by special permit.   

          And it meets the buffer standards that Jeff had 

mentioned before, relative to schools, playgrounds, athletic 

fields and recreation facilities. 

          And this is kind of the site plan as it exists 

today.  You'll notice a preexisting nonconforming parking 

lot that is not -- to be candid -- not particularly well 

laid out; many kind of parking spaces that abut directly 

into one another, large curb cut; pediatricians walking 

directly from the store into the parking lot and I would say 

modern, urban design objectives -- not the best way to kind 

of situate a site. 

          And we certainly think that the proposed 

conditions are much better and certainly something that the

community will be happy as an addition for. 

          Go to the next slide. 

          So just to point out some of the modifications on 

the actual site plan itself, proposed by this applicant: 

They're proposing to narrow the curb site down to 22 feet, 

enhancing vehicular safety on the roadway and in the parking 

lot, right?  Making a much easier access point. 

          They're planning to use a concrete walk for 

pedestrians within that parking lot, allowing them to enter 

and exit the facility in a safe manner.  And we'll talk a 

little bit more about those entrances and exits later on in 

this application. 

          They've reconfigured the parking lot as it stands, 

while maintaining five spaces, including an accessible 

space.  The cars are no longer backing up into each other, 

and it will be much easier for vehicles to kind of cross the 

parking lot. 

          And they've also implemented bike storage on the 

site.  So there's five short-term bicycle racks; each with 

two spaces, so 10 spaces total, and then two long-term 

storage areas. 

          And this site is as well accessible by public

transit as well.  You'll note that it's perhaps a couple 

hundred feet away from the Lechmere MBTA station; easy 

access to the 80, 87,88 and 69 buses, and located in close 

proximity to a Bluebikes station near Lechmere if folks are 

seeking -- you know, to do a quick bike ride in lieu of 

walking.   

site.   

          And we've proposed I think some landscaping 

elements that would appropriate as well on the site.  You'll 

notice the installation of three birch trees around the 

          Just a quick note, relative:  I know CDD had 

presented -- you know, proposed in its recommendations on 

the project some additional trees along the sidewalk.  The 

Project Team is a bit concerned that adding additional trees 

will not be great in terms of lines of sight. 

          And we've also added some ornamental [38:51 

indiscernible rapid] and river rocks in the front and side 

of the parking lot.  And per CD's suggestions, they're very 

comfortable with the idea of other low-level plantings that 

will make it a bit more of an oasis -- more so than a 

parking lot -- add additional screening from the street, and 

are certainly amenable to the idea of raised beds, if the

Board prefers that, just for some more visually appealing 

plantings. 

          And we've also added a bit of lighting on the 

site.  There's existing lighting on the building that we 

would be proposing taking off along the west side of the 

building, installing some down light -- exterior lighting to 

ensure that drivers and pedestrians are able to safely 

traverse the parking lot and the sidewalk immediately in 

front of the facility.   

          But certainly, we'll be using a downcast -- it's 

not a required element of security, so it doesn't need to 

stay on at all times at night.  The security systems 

function just fine using infrared. 

          And taking a look a bit at the exterior of the 

building, we have I think really done our best to make it a 

little bit more visually appealing on the exterior, while 

still making a bit of a nuanced façade towards the more 

residential portion of the property. 

          So one, you'll notice the new screening on the 

roof of the building, to cover the HVAC.  I believe there's 

existing HVAC equipment there now, but it's perhaps not 

appropriately screened.  We would anticipate new HVAC would

be installed, and new, more visually appealing screening 

would accompany it. 

          We've added an extended awning in front of the 

main entryway of the facility to add depth, added some 

signage on the northeast side, and maintained in response I 

think really the residence feedback on nuanced façade on 

Third Street, just to make it kind of a visually appealing 

without being just in your face out there.   

           I know CDD had suggested that there might be some 

ways to incorporate some murals on the side of the building 

at a presentation that we did in the past, that had 

incorporated murals.   

          We got a very -- I would say colorful response 

from the community on that, but we'd [41:17 audio unclear 

want the exterior ] forethought; at the point we would be 

happy to do so, but are sensitive to their desire to 

maintain -- to restrict any kind of loitering on the site or 

lingering, which is not in accordance with the Cannabis 

Control Commission's regulations. 

          So this is the existing conditions as they are 

today.  And you'll notice that for many passersby, the look 

will not change too much, because the large, picturesque

windows for many years have been covered by hanging rugs, 

due to the previous use of the building. 

          And here is the -- kind of the exterior as we 

propose it today.  We're proposing a very, very similar 

exterior context to what the Board previously approved for a 

[42:03 same indiscernible proper name] which is rotating 

semi-quarterly public art demonstrations in the first-floor 

windows along Third Street and Monsignor O'Brien through a 

partnership with the Cambridge Arts Council, or perhaps any 

kind of local organizations and are happy to condition that 

as part of the decision. 

          The interior displays -- I think one of the Board 

members the previous time, you know, had a thoughtful 

suggestion that it would be much better if they were offset 

from the window, gives a perception of depth, while at the 

same time having open areas in the top of the window frame.  

          And if you take a look at the materials previously 

presented, I neglected to include kind of a bit of a 

rendering on what that might look like, to allow light in 

from the top of the facilities, so that there is natural 

light within the facility, without giving any -- you know, 

unsightly or unintended glimpse into the facility.

          So speaking a little bit about the actual floor 

plan and layout, in accordance with what we would say are 

best practices in kind of the cannabis base, we have a 

separate entry and exit for customers.   

          So customers will enter along Monsignor O'Brien 

Highway.  They'll be required to show their ID into that 

little -- almost kind of like a nook or an electronic 

doorbell prior to gaining access.                  

          There's an interior vestibule that can accommodate 

about 0 occupants at any given time.  And as I discussed 

later, we're proposing an appointment-only system to start, 

to ensure that we can manage the flow within that vestibule. 

          And the sales floor, you know, once a customer has 

shown the appropriate credentials that they are 21 years of 

age or older, the sales floor can actually accommodate 40 

folks.  It is not the intention of the applicant to have 40 

customers in there at any given time.   

          Typically, we would expect a 1:1 ratio with the 

point of sale station, but it was a big community concern 

that we were able to appropriately mitigate queuing along 

the exterior of the facility, given its proximity to 

Monsignor O'Brien Highway, and giving the lack of desire for

obstruction of that sidewalk, for Third Street or for folks 

walking along Monsignor. 

          So it certainly can accommodate more than that.  

You'll notice that there's doors along the window, and those 

doors are actually to let staff in to change the rotating 

window displays, which we would anticipate happening a few 

times a year. 

          And then they can make their way up to a point of 

sale queue, where they -- actually if you don't mind just 

going back one slide? Yeah, perfect. 

          A point of sale queue, and, you know, they would 

be given customer education materials, show their ID again 

at the point of sale.  I won't belabor kind of the Cannabis 

Control Commission regulations regarding sale, as as you 

know this is -- I believe the twelfth cannabis applicant 

before this Board, but I'm happy to answer any questions 

about the regulations, should you have any, as they relate 

to this floor plan. 

          And then they will be able to leave through the 

secure customer exit, which requires them to go through a 

series of double doors, which -- again, is a kind of best-

in-standard security practice to eliminate unintended access 

25

into the facility. 

          There is a separate staff and loading entry, that 

allows for direct access to the second floor of the 

building.  People are not able to gain second-floor access 

without going through that door.   

          And so, a separate access point.  And the 

applicant -- this is the existing condition of the doors.  

They're already set up this way, with the exception of one 

of the doors is a bit of a loading bay. 

          This is the applicant's preferred configuration of 

the doors, the way that it's already set up, because it 

allows for best practices in terms of diversion, access 

control, and a separate loading area. 

          All right, perfect. 

          And you'll notice the upstairs is intended for 

staff only.  There is a very robust fulfillment and bulk 

area, as well as you'll notice kind of the square -- I 

believe it says, "CLST" - a dumbwaiter that goes between the 

floors to transport products, as well as -- 

          Yeah, right there. 

          -- as well as some offices, a pantry and break 

room that can double as actually a -- sort of an educational

room for training, a cash office for the accounting and safe 

storage of cash, changing room, and restroom. 

          In terms of traffic and queuing, you know, one 

thing I'd like to note:  You know, at this point in the 

cannabis market in Massachusetts, you know, as of about two 

months ago, 59 of the marijuana retailers have opened.   

          There was 153 that have received some kind of 

license from the Cannabis Control Commission, and are 

preparing to open, whether they're building now or perhaps, 

you know, waiting to be on a Cannabis Control Commission 

agenda for the final license, or stocking the shelves in 

their stores, and 150 applications that are pending. 

          So there are a number of marijuana establishments 

that by the time this applicant opens will have already 

opened their door -- significantly lessening the demand.   

          And I think, you know, certainly what folks can 

see as they look around the Commonwealth is that with the 

continued increase of opening of marijuana dispensaries, 

some of the traffic and queuing nightmares that we've heard 

about in Leicester or in Northampton, you know, simply are 

not as much of a problem, if a problem at all today. 

          Nevertheless, this applicant understands the

importance of doing a kind of a nuanced opening period.  So 

in here we have for the first three months of operation, 

what I'd really like to stress is what we would be hoping to 

do is operate on an appointment-only basis, until either the 

Board or its designees from the city deemed it appropriate, 

given the other demand in the city, or the demand at the 

site, to release us from an appointment-only phase. 

          You know, if it turns out that an appointment-only 

base is needed, which would demonstrate, right, by always 

having appointments booked up all the time, we would really 

never have a lack of appointments, right?  Because if you're 

always booked, it's good for business.  You know where your 

sales are coming from.   

          But what we would hope to do is meet with 

designees, you know, should the time be right to come off of 

an appointment-only phase to make that decision in 

coordination with the Board, with the Police Department, 

ECPT, the East Cambridge Business Association -- you know, 

making sure that it was in the right interest of the 

community and that nobody feels as if it was too soon. 

          We would approach a phased reopening right, 

perhaps lesser demand period to start would be where we 

28

would start kind of removing the restrictions on 

appointment-only.  But certainly only after close 

coordination with City Staff. 

          And again, up to 50 customers can safely be 

accommodated inside at any time.  But we don't ever 

anticipate reaching that occupancy.  The only time I could 

ever really see it happening was you have a number of 

appointments and there's a sudden rainstorm outside, so 

nobody can leave the facility to get to public transit 

nearby. 

          And we have an extensive opening day planned for 

the Board to review in our special permit materials that can 

answer other questions about communication with the city. 

          In terms of safe loading, this site is perfect 

from a loading perspective, because it has a parking lot 

that the applicants utilize on site to securely load 

products into the facility.  They would come in straight 

through that loading door, go right up the stairs and into 

the fulfillment and vault areas. 

          Any waste containing marijuana would be brought 

right back to the cultivation and product manufacturing 

facility from which it emanated, and would not be stored on 

29

site, except, you know, for that time that we were waiting 

for it to be sent out. 

          We would anticipate commercial trash approximately 

one time a week, and I'm noting that this will not be a 

distribution point for home deliveries. 

          You know, certainly the applicant has extensive 

security plans that it's prepared to share with the Board if 

desired.  But just like any other applicant before this 

Board, there's stringent access control procedures 

maintaining strict control over who's in the facility at any 

given time.   

          There will be perimeter security, including motion 

sensors, alarms, video surveillance, intrusion detection 

centers, holdup alarms, panic alarms strategically 

throughout the facility.   

          There will be multiple alarm systems operational 

to ensure that the system does not go down and the instance 

the power goes out.  Live security guards will monitor the 

camera feeds on site during all hours of operation, and you 

will have a 24/7 dispatch team doing offsite monitoring, in 

addition to looking into the Cambridge Police Department if 

they desire.

22

          And when not -- you know, when not being sold to a 

customer all products will be located in this secure vault 

under video surveillance. 

          Not all employees will have access to the vaults.  

There will be a layered, tiered access system -- you know, 

managers have access to the vault for instance; you know, 

assistant managers and inventory specialists will be in the 

fulfillment area, and then -- you know, from there on out. 

          So nuisance: So we recognize in this particular 

portion of Cambridge the neighborhood is very active, and it 

is our desire to continue to be a good neighborhood partner.  

I think the testament of that is the fact that there's 

actually a Chief Engagement Officer on this team, who will 

be attending each meeting of the East Cambridge Planning 

Team, be participating actively in the East Cambridge 

Business Association...  and really seeking to be an active 

part of the community, so that if folks have questions about 

happenings on site, they have a person and a face that they 

can contact, as opposed to just reaching out to a 1-800 

number that goes to nowhere. 

          So no public consumption will be allowed on site. 

And if City officials say that there's some area of concern 

31

in the immediate vicinity, we'll offer to install video 

surveillance at that location.   

          I think in particular there is a park well over 

300 feet away, but that was of concern to the neighbors, and 

if the city desired, we would certainly be willing to assist 

in monitoring there. 

          All of our customers will go through an intake 

process where they receive a primer on regulations 

surrounding cannabis, how to safely consume, store and 

transfer the product, and in particular information 

regarding dosage and desired effects. 

          And to actually become a customer, you're required 

to sign that every time you walk in via an iPad to emphasize 

that commitment to community.   

          Anyone who engages in public consumption, 

diversion, exterior queuing, loitering, littering -- kind of 

any other nuisance behavior -- that type of behavior isn't 

tolerated, and will kind of put you on a list, you'll not be 

allowed entry to the store moving forward.   

          Products will arrive prepackaged, limiting the 

odor impact.  It is best practice to put a carbon filtration 

system, a carbon scrubber, in the vault area, which is the

main collection of marijuana from the facility.  So we will 

certainly do that just to ensure there's no public nuisance. 

          Medical operations -- so Nuestra currently does 

not propose a marijuana dispensary at the site, although it 

will provide programs with these qualifying patients within 

the city or neighborhood who are registered.  It is largely 

the same product that is being sold; the exception is dosage 

limits.   

          If you are a medical use of marijuana patient, you 

are eligible for much higher doses of marijuana, for 

instance an Edible product or in a concentrate than an 

adult-use customer. 

          But I would like to explain just for a minute why 

this decision has been made, because Nuestra certainly is 

committed to the medical program, and in an ideal world 

would be offering medical use marijuana, you know, at the 

same as adult-use through this site.  And I know it's 

something the neighborhood is very interested in as well.   

          In Massachusetts, there's a term called, "Vertical 

integration" which requires the Medical Use of Marijuana 

Program participants to grow essentially what they sell.  

Right?  You have to have a cultivation and product

manufacturing facility attached onto your registered 

marijuana dispensary. 

          And while it is -- it certainly makes for a great 

vertical market, it's incredibly capital intensive to put 

together a thoughtful cultivation facility.  We have $5 

million and $10 million here, but it has realistically 

you're talking at least $15 -- to $20 -- to do all that 

extra. 

          And it's an investment that theoretically could be 

done through the investment in the market at the latest 

time.  But I think it is too capital intensive for this 

particular applicant at this time.   

          We were hopeful, the Cannabis Control Commission 

was contemplating changes to eliminate vertical integration 

during this regulatory season, but I did find out last week 

that they have proposed to hold off for the time being until 

the next round of regulatory changing.   

          But in the instance of that change, you know, it 

would take, you know, a matter of however long I could draft 

an application up, to apply that -- add Medical Use of 

Marijuana at this site.  That's certainly a commitment that 

we may see through our Planning team, and would move to this

Board as well.   

          [Whoo!] and with that, in an attempt to be as 

quick as possible, I think I've hit it all, and welcome any 

questions or comments that the Board might have.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you 

so much.  We are going to actually go first to public 

comment.  This is a public hearing, and any members of the 

public who wish to speak should now click the button that 

says, "Raise hand."  If you're calling in by phone, you can 

raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had not 

received any written comments on this case, and written 

communications received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday will be 

entered into the record. 

          I'll now ask staff to unmute any speakers one at a 

time.  You should begin by saying your name and address, and 

staff will confirm that we can hear you.  And after that, 

we'll have up to three minutes to speak before I ask you to 

wrap up. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  This is Jeff Roberts 

with Community Development again, and at this time there 

don't appear to be any hands raised.  So I'll just repeat

the instruction.   

          Anybody that would like to be heard on this case, 

this is at 200 Monsignor O'Brien Highway retail cannabis 

proposal.  If you want to be heard, please push the button 

that says, "Raise hand" on Zoom, or you can -- if you're 

participating by phone, press *9 on your phone.   

          [Pause]  

          All right, I gave it about 10 seconds.  It doesn't 

appear that there's anybody who is eager to speak on this 

particular case, so I will turn it back over to the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you, Jeff.  All right, then we'll move from public comment 

to Board discussion, and if the hearing is continued to a 

future date and additional information received, then there 

will be an opportunity for the public to comment on the 

additional materials. And of course, additional written 

comments may also be submitted.   

          So we've received memos on this application from 

CDD and Traffic and Parking, both of whom are available.  So 

are there questions for the staff or the applicant at this 

time from Board members?  And if so, just start by saying 

your name and chiming in.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Hi, this is Corinne with a 

question for the applicant, and I also have a question for 

staff.  In the parking memo, it does say that an approved 

plan was given to applicant.  Does that mean that the 

applicant agreed to the plan, or is that still in question 

as a question for Staff?   

          And then for the applicant, I'm looking at the 

sections titled, "Security and Preventing Nuisance." in the 

application.   

          And I wanted to note that for some members of the 

community, they might feel safe and secure with a 27-year 

veteran of the Boston Police Department designing the 

security plan, but for other members of the community, a 27-

year veteran of the Boston Police Department might make them 

feel unsafe.  

          So I wanted to know a little more about how the 

security plan will balance with what the required and 

desired security functions we have, with all community 

members feeling welcome and safe in the area, and 

specifically if the plan involves armed, uniformed police at 

the site and how many?   

          And then I also had a question for the applicant,

if they could specifically explain what programs will be 

provided to assist qualifying medical patients.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So why don't we start 

with applicant responses first, and then we can turn to the 

staff on the question regarding the parking.     

          REBECCA RUTENBERG:  Certainly.  Specific to the 

security plan, you know, certain [59:36 audio unclear] that 

there's a desire to balance meeting the regulatory 

constraints provided by the Cannabis Control Commission and 

that may be desired by the Cambridge Police Department with 

kind of community-based security measures that make this 

community feel comfortable. 

          And certainly not -- you know, not to speak for 

Ivelisse and Renata, but as individuals who -- individuals 

who their application to the Cannabis Control Commission is 

largely based on their commitment to community education, in 

areas that have been disproportionately impacted by drug 

enforcement in the past.  Communities know that first of all 

this is 100 percent top of mind and something that we care 

deeply about. 

          And so, I think as we approach security systems, 

it is important first to know that utilizing someone who has

27 years of experience in policing helps to ensure that the 

measure we do put in place that we get right, while at the 

same time allowing the lens that this applicant brings to 

the proposal, to think about the impact that our security 

measures have on the surrounding community…  and finding in 

the instance -- right -- of areas that may make certain 

community members feel insecure or uncomfortable in ways 

that we might not expect; identifying alternatives from an 

evidence-based standard. 

          So there will certainly not be the armed guard or 

guards in uniform.  Security staff will be in plainclothes, 

in very similar attire to the retail sales associates. 

          They would be going through, you know, conflict 

de-escalation training as well as kind of community-based 

training to ensure that they are able to work 

collaboratively towards a solution to deescalate situations, 

you know, and are operating in continued I would say 

compliance with the core ethos of Nuestra, if that makes 

sense.   

          And certainly from the Medical Use of Marijuana 

Program perspective, we would be seeking to provide our 

agents with similar training that medical marijuana agents

would have in terms of utilizing cannabis as a means to 

which to assist, you know, in -- you know, providing certain 

types of relief, right? 

          So our -- it wouldn't just be, you know, what 

effects does this have, but also kind of what symptoms are 

you looking to treat -- you have very similar types of 

conversations that you would have in any medical facility.   

          And similarly, you know, unlike the biggest 

challenge is unfortunately we would still be providing a 

heavily taxed product.  So in the instance -- and we are 

unable to provide discounts, based on Cannabis Control 

Commission regulations in the adult-use market. 

          So in the instance that there was a patient with a 

verified hardship, right?  It would largely be working with 

kind of sister dispensaries, if you will, to identify a 

different solution for that, that may result -- you know, in 

either pointing them to a different dispensary, but may 

offer them home delivery or something in terms of 

convenience for them. 

          So it certainly would depend on the situation, but 

the commitment to providing patients access and care is 

still there.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  And then 

Corinne had also had a question about the parking plan.  

Adam, do you want to speak to that?   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Sure, I'd be happy to.  This is 

Adam Shulman from the Cambridge Traffic Parking and 

Transportation Department.  So this site had an unregistered 

parking lot.  Essentially, it had parking spaces that it had 

was never registered as part of the city's parking inventory 

when it was done in the 1990s. 

          And so, what happens in cases like that and 

projects, they need to come in compliance with the city's 

parking regulations.   

          And so, the previous owner had to do it, and now 

this owner sort of had to also do it, which was to -- in 

order to get a permitted, officially permitted parking lot, 

they needed to complete a Parking and Transportation 

management plan through the city's PTDM Planning Officer, 

which was Stefanie Groll is the city's PDTM Planning 

Officer.  

          And so, it's -- this regulation is dictated by a 

city ordinance.  It's actually 10.18.  So it's actually a 

41

separate ordinance, or separate regulation than a Planning 

Board special permit.  It covers essentially parking 

facilities-- all the parking facilities in the city. 

          So in order -- since this project needed to do 

that, and register their parking lot and therefore having an 

approved PTDM plan as it's known, that had to be 

accomplished before this -- any project can receive a permit 

from any of the Boards of the city -- either a Planning 

Board, or License Commission or BZA. 

          So the regulations say that any project -- any 

property that has parking needs to be registered, and if 

there's more parking spaces than there were in 1990, then 

that would trigger this requirement to do a PTDM plan, which 

has to be approved by the city's PTDM Officer, and that 

needs to be completed before any Board can issue a permit. 

          So it's -- you know, it's a required permit, 

separate really from zoning and separate from the Planning 

Board.  But what it did was that as a part of their PTDM 

plan, they agreed to conditions which would be very similar 

to the same conditions that Traffic Department would 

normally recommend anyways for a Planning Board special 

permit. 

42

          So that's why you see in the letter from the 

Traffic Department a list of TDM -- Transportation Demand 

Management measures -- which they had to commit to, or they 

have committed to under the PTDM plan.   

          And so, we're just letting you know that they've 

committed to those things under their PTDM permit, which we 

would recommend also be linked as a requirement for this 

special permit as well, just so things are consistent.   

          But it sort of just happens to be that in this 

particular project, because of their parking lot, they had 

to already work with the city to get an agreement on these 

measures.   

          So that's what we were trying to explain in our 

letter.  Hopefully that helped a little bit, but let me know 

if not, or there's other questions.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  No, that's perfect.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  All 

right.  Are there other questions from Board members for 

staff or for the applicant?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have a question, it's for you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.

report listed some potential design improvements.  And I'm 

wanting to know if the applicant is willing to do the site 

and sidewalk improvements including more planting, more 

street trees?    

          I know you mentioned you didn't want to put in 

more street trees, but we're at a time in our city's history 

where we need to do it wherever we can. 

          And there are additional items which I think you 

should work with the staff to see how feasible they are.  

But anyway, are you going to -- you're willing to commit to 

more trees?     

          REBECCA RUTENBERG:  Absolutely.  I don't think 

anything listed by staff was a dealbreaker in any sort, and 

we would certainly be open to working with them to 

incorporate any and all portions of their recommendations 

into the application.  You know, certainly want to do -- you 

know, to do right by this particular property and make sure 

it's done in accordance with Urban Design adjusted for the 

city.   

          If it is possible to condition those items for 

continuing Design Review of some kind, we would be 

appreciative of that, just given the -- kind of the

challenges associated with caring of a building during 

COVID, candidly.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, and I'd like to just 

reinforce what you said about the planting and the need for 

street trees here.  This corner is basically a desert.  It's 

in full sun all the time; it really needs the help. And you 

were talking about lower planters.  See if you can get both 

-- make this place really look like something; maybe that 

will attract you some more business. 

          My other question is can someone explain what's 

going on with the driveway?  Is the curb cut being 

shortened, relocated?  It does not appear shorter.  I'd just 

like to see something on that.   

          And one other thing right off the bat, no 

renderings with the rooftop mechanicals?  There are some 

drawings.  It would have been nice to have seen a rendering 

with the rooftop mechanicals.     

          REBECCA RUTENBERG:  And Tony, are you available to 

provide context on that curb cut?   

          TONY CAPACHIETTI:  Yeah, the curb cut width from 

what was existing is being reduced considerably.  With -- oh

I apologize, Tony Capachietti with Hayes Engineering, 603 

Salem Street, Wakefield, Massachusetts.   

          So the original curb cut was almost 45 feet wide.  

It had all five spaces backing out directly onto Monsignor 

O'Brien Highway.  The new curb cut is 22 feet.  And the 

issue comes with the cars backing out.  We could neck it 

down a little bit more at the gutter line, but the 22 feet 

gives you ample room for two cars to pass with a little 

space on either side.  And that's usually what we like to go 

with. 

          And again, that's about half of the width from 

what was there.  And what you have is a unique situation 

with the bike path, and the planter and the reconstructed 

Monsignor O'Brien Highway that was reported by BHB to the 

          It's kind of along the curb cut into the site.  So 

the 22 feet in width helps with the turning movements as 

Mass DOT.    

well.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, so it was hard to 

determine the change.  Didn't show an existing length on the 

curb cut.  It's kind of --    

          TONY CAPACHIETTI:  Right.   

46

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- is this -- this curb is 

just depressed most of the way from the corner?     

          TONY CAPACHIETTI:  It is.  So the -- in the 

existing condition, almost the whole length of that parking 

lot is open.  And what we're proposing is tying into the 

revised Monsignor O'Brien Highway layout.   

          So that curb line is going to move out 

considerably to accommodate a raised bicycle track, as well 

as a planter strip between the sidewalk and the building.  I 

apologize.  I'm on my cell phone, and every time it rings it 

kind of throws me off for a second. 

          So, again, we're reducing that curb cut by about 

half of what's there existing.  And 22 feet is pretty 

standard per Mass DOT curb cut width.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Any other questions for the applicant or for Staff on this?          

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Madam Chair, this is Tom.  I have 

a couple of questions.  I agree, first of all, with Lou and 

Hugh that this site seems to be oddly above the tree line, 

and really, we should address that.  It's absolutely barren 

in that block, actually. 

          It's hard to do this without being in the hearing

room.  Here I'm going to be a victim of Zoom, but I was 

looking at DD-02, which shows a section at the wall of the 

art display, and the clear story that you're proposing and 

explaining brings sunlight into the store.   

          It's simply a -- you know, just quibbling with the 

detail there -- whether that interior wall could be brought 

down to a height that would be conforming to the cannabis 

regulations, but might allow staff members inside that room 

to actually get a glimpse of the sky, if that wall -- the 

art wall, was brought down somewhere around five feet or 

five and a half feet. 

          You wouldn't be able to see the sky; you'd still 

have the art the way it's currently configured.  I don't 

know how much light gets into the space at all. 

          That's the inside of the building, but I think it 

also makes a big difference from the public interest.  The 

public interest would give a sense of light and activity -- 

a well-lit business from the street, and I think that makes 

a huge difference to a sense of activity, a sense of 

something going on that isn't nefarious inside that 

building.  And it shouldn't be completely blank.  So that's 

my opinion, and I think there's a public interest there.

          Lastly, there's been reference to the number of -- 

if you're successful, the number of patrons, and I hope you 

are.  Maybe as many as 40. I count 10 staff members, which 

puts you at 50 people potentially in that room.   

          I would check with your architect, because at 50 

people, Hugh would advise you that you need two proper 

exits, and I would make sure that your doorways were 

conforming; in other words, the door swings probably should 

swing out to be conforming.  But that's a building code 

issue.  Those are my three things, Madam Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  With that, I 

think we're transitioning nicely to Board discussion.  If 

anyone has any further questions, we'll take -- Staff or the 

applicant will take them.  Otherwise, I'm certainly happy to 

hear more comments from Board members as part of our 

discussion on this application.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  All right.  So I have heard so 

far comments from Tom and from Lou, and I have some 

questions from Corinne.  I'm going to start with folks I 

haven't heard from yet, and just confirm whether or not you 

have any comments for discussion?   

          Ted Cohen?

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I really have no comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I agree with everything that 

the others have said.  I agree with the recommendations from 

Staff, and whatever we need to incorporate in addition to 

the PTDM plan.  But as they said, this is like our tenth or 

twelfth marijuana facility.  It had been approved for 

medical marijuana before.  I see no reason to belabor the 

point and just move forward with it.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Oh, I 

neglected to note that I had also gotten questions from 

Hugh.  Steven Cohen?  Any comments or questions from you?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I agree with Ted's great insight 

that we need less people to belabor the issue.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I do agree with the point that 

was made about trees.  I hadn’t thought of that the first 

time around; I was focusing on the building.  But -- and as 

you may recall from previous hearings, I focus entirely on 

the exterior of the buildings, and not the interior.  This 

is not a wonderful building, but I think they've done as 

well as can be done with the building.  But trees would add

a lot.  So I support that.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

From the folks we did get questions from, anyone want to add 

any additional thoughts or comments?   

          So far, I've heard strong support for the staff 

memos, both at Traffic and Parking and CDD that the PTDM 

plan be incorporated as a condition, and that the applicant 

work with staff on continuing Design Review, including those 

potential design improvements that had been listed in the 

Staff memo, particularly the incorporation of trees on the 

site. 

          Are there additional comments or points for 

discussion that any Board members have that have not been 

covered?  All right.  Then, my sense is that the Board is 

prepared to review the necessary findings that we need to 

make for this, and in order to -- excuse me, we're ready to 

review the findings we need to make in order to grant the 

special permit.   

          So I will review those findings and then just 

inquire as to whether any Board members have any objections 

or concerns or want to note anything about the findings that 

we need to further discuss.

          So, the findings for cannabis retail store is that 

it's in a qualifying district; it is located in a permanent 

building; not within 1800 feet of another cannabis retail 

stores; not within 300 feet of an existing public or private 

K-12 school or 300 feet of a public children's playground, 

public youth athletic field, public youth recreational 

facility; or that the Planning Board finds it is 

sufficiently buffered from the same. 

          That there will be no packaging or repackaging of 

cannabis products on site.  That the site design provides 

convenient, safe and secure access and egress required as an 

employee using all modes of transportation. 

          The location and design of the cannabis use will 

not detract from the sense of activity with opaque, 

unwelcoming façade. 

          Loading and refuse and service areas are designed 

to be secure and shielded from abutting users.  The building 

and site are designed to be compatible with other buildings 

in the area, and to mitigate any negative aesthetic impacts 

that might result from required security measures and 

restrictions on visibility, and that the facility will 

provide programs to assist qualifying patients in obtaining 

services under the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana 

52

Program. 

Criteria.   

          And then of course the General Special Permit 

           So are Board members comfortable making those 

findings, or does anyone have any concerns or other points 

they'd like to make about this?               

          [Pause] Okay.   

          Hearing none, move on to conditions.  As I 

previously noted, the CDD and Traffic and Parking memos 

contain suggested conditions to be included in the special 

permit decisions, and then there are also the standard 

conditions for continuing review and certification by Staff 

that the conditions are met. 

          I think the comments I have heard from the Board 

indicate that there's a desire to emphasize the tree portion 

of the recommendations from Staff.  But are there additional 

items we want to emphasize or add total staff 

recommendations, either through CDD or Traffic and Parking?          

          HUGH RUSSELL:  This is Hugh.  I think we should 

add to the list Tom's comment about making the first story 

taller, so more natural light can come into the space, and

that people would get a sense of what was going on.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  And Hugh, just to 

clarify, would that be akin to the other potential design 

improvements listed in the Staff memo to be explored with 

staff as a subject of continuing Design Review, or --     

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you.  

Anything else?

          Are there any suggestions from staff?  Oh, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  The only other thing is there's 

been an indication that initially the facility will be by 

appointment-only.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:   I know we had a lengthy 

discussion about it I think at our last meeting, and there 

was some generalized language that I think has been 

presented with regard to appointment only until such time as 

-- I believe it's now staff and Traffic and Parking conclude 

that it's no longer necessary.   

          So I think that language and something along those 

lines ought to be included.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's a good point, 

Ted.  The applicant had offered that, and I agree that 

especially where the applicant is offering that this Board 

is supportive of starting out with appointment-only and 

letting staff work with the applicant to determine when it 

is no longer necessary.  All right.   

          Any other comments from the Board?  Any 

suggestions from staff?  Anything I've missed from the staff 

point of view?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff.  I don't have 

anything additional, but I'll just give any staff members if 

they think of anything a few seconds to chime in.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I've been seeing 

Adam's hand raised.  So Adam, did I miss something for you?   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  No, I would just -- thank you, 

Madam Chair.  I just want to make sure we clarified the 

Traffic Department's letter reiterates items in the PTDM 

plan.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  I think there's no concerns about 

that, but I also want to just make sure it's also clear that 

there's a few additional comments and recommendations not

related that to the PTDM plan per se, but suggestions that 

be part of the special permit.   

          And this -- for instance the 100% T pass subsidy, 

these are things that are pretty common in all of the other 

cannabis retail storage projects that you have heard or 

seen. 

          So I just wanted to make sure that that was on the 

record, and that there wasn't any issues with those?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, thank you for 

clarifying, Adam.  I -- certainly it was this Board member's 

intent to incorporate all of the suggestions and conditions 

from the Traffic and Parking memo.  And if any Board members 

object to us doing that, now would be the time to say so.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Hi.  This is Erik Thorkildsen, 

CDD.  Just a question:  We did have in the memo the idea of 

incorporating painted murals on some of the exterior, and 

the applicant says there's community resistance to that.  

And so, I just wondered if you guys wanted to say something 

one way or another about that?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I'll open that up to 

other Board members.  I do not have a strong feeling one way 

or another on that.  I -- for me, I'm perfectly comfortable

having that be a matter of continuing discussion with the 

staff and the community without imposing my personal 

aesthetics on that.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess I would comment that was -- 

I felt that the murals were problematic because the building 

is such an idiosyncratic building.  I couldn't quite see how 

that was going to work aesthetically, since the three 

exposed sides are pretty much consistent with the public 

art.  So I think it would be better not to have murals.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Two quick ones.  I'll agree 

with Hugh, I think it'll get kind of confusing, and also, I 

have heard a lot of comments from the public about murals on 

this building.  It's not really received well.    

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Okay, thank you.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So it 

sounds like Board members are definitely not looking to make 

that a condition at this time?  If there is some artistic 

treatment, that the community, the applicant and staff all 

agree is wonderful, that would I presume be considered to be 

part of continuing Design Review, unless staff has questions 

about it, in which case they can always bring it back to us 

57

to clarify.             

          All right.  Is there a motion to grant the 

requested special permits with those conditions, based on 

the Board's finding that the applicant -- the applicable 

special permit criteria have been met? Remember to say your 

name when making a motion.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On the motion to grant the special 

permit, Lou Bacci?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.

switch gears to our second agenda item of the evening, which 

is a public hearing on a zoning petition by Arvind -- I 

apologize, I'm going to botch this name -- Srinivasau, et 

al. to amend Section 20.90 of the zoning ordinance and the 

provisions to the Alewife Overlay Districts, in particular 

the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest subdistrict. 

          So we're going to again start with CDD staff

summarizing procedurally how this is before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  So this is a petition -

- zoning petition -- that was referred by the Council to the 

Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee in June.  This is 

similar to a petition that was heard by the Planning Board 

in 2019.   

Staff. 

          The Board did not submit a recommendation on that 

petition, but made a number of comments to be studied 

further by the petitioners' representatives, who are from 

the company, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, in consultation with 

          So the Ordinance Committee hearing for this hasn't 

been scheduled yet, as I indicated earlier.  The Planning 

Board's action with zoning petitions is to make an Advisory 

recommendation to the City Council, and CDD provided a memo 

with some information on the new petition, and we also 

provided some background materials that were submitted on 

the earlier version of the petition of the Planning Board 

heard at that time.  That's all for me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  We will now 

turn to the presenter, Jay Doherty from Cabot, Cabot & 

Forbes, representing the petitioners.  Again, you'll have up

hope you'll be as concise as possible, and please introduce 

your petitioner team, as we get started here.

us?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is Mr. Doherty with 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff again.  I wonder if 

anybody from the petitioner's team is present and wants to 

and can, who is here and who's speaking?  You can just -- 

you can unmute yourself and turn on your video and begin the 

presentation.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff.  Can you hear us now?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, we can.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Sorry about that, we were in a 

different room.  But hold on one second.  Jay's in -- hold 

on --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  Thank you members of the Board for 

once again hearing from us on this.  Going back about a 

year, we first visited you what we --

Forbes.  The purpose of the petition is to help us 

facilitate two pieces of improvements that we hope will 

benefit the Alewife area.   

          The first of these is a bridge that would run from 

the top of Smith Place over the MBTA tracks, which is a 

distance of about 150 feet, and eventually ramp down and tie 

into the cul-de-sac up Cambridge Park Drive. 

          And we believe this is a very important piece of 

infrastructure for the area to solve some of the mobility 

questions that have come up. 

          Joined with that are features to create at the 

ground-floor level a neighborhood amenities center comprised 

of those activities that are in the area, such as the rock 

climbing club, such as fitness clubs, craft breweries, that 

can provide a place in this area.  

          I estimate that to date there are 6000 new 

residents in the area, and about 6000 new daytime employees 

in life sciences.  And none of these really -- other than 

what happened on recently on Cambridge Park Drive, have a 

very rich amenity base to use in the Alewife area. 

          The reason that the petition is helpful is it 

allows us to garner some FAR bonus that is associated with

the developer of the bridge, and in addition facilitate the 

neighborhood amenities in Light Industrial and community-

facing amenities that we've discussed that need considerable 

height.   

          And thus the petition asks for an increase in the 

commercial height here, which is right now 55 feet -- 

residential is already 80 feet -- and to take that to 85 

feet and on the ground floor, only to be triggered by the 

development of the bridge and by the presentation of the 

space as we have talked about -- tall space for Light 

Industrial use, and some of these community-facing users. 

          And that is what the purpose of the petition.  

When we saw you last year, we presented a petition, you had 

comments, and what the presentation does is take you through 

what your comments were.   

          By the way, your comments were pretty similar to 

what the City Council commented.  So in working with Jeff 

and others, I think that we are addressing as well the 

comments they gave us. 

          I'd like to add just one thing, and then I'd turn 

it over to Jacob to try and walk you through the record of 

those comments, which is I think we all understand that the

pandemic is something that's present today, and we don't 

know what it's going to be like in three or four years.  But 

clearly what is happening is that consumers are beginning to 

base decisions on today's conditions.   

          And one of the things that we've seen developing 

in the real estate market is that people are seeking 

increasingly to put themselves within walking distance to 

their place of employment.   

          Alewife has developed quite an employment base, 

and therefore matching this mobility infrastructure is 

something that I think will be very desirable.   

          The Alewife area has held its leasing for 

residential tenants considerably better than other areas, 

particularly downtown Boston.  And I think it's primarily 

because of this proximity.   

          I think the desire for walking shows that people 

want to live near their workplace, but are still thinking 

somewhat reluctantly about how public transportation can 

help them. 

          So that's what we're trying to accomplish here, 

and Jacob will look at your comments and talk a little bit 

about how we hope we have worked with the Planning Staff to 

64

address this.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JACOB VANCE:  Hey everyone, thank you.  I don't 

have control over the presentation, but if you can keep 

flipping slides a little bit.   

          So as Jay mentioned, you know, the purpose of this 

petition is bridging those amenities, but more generally 

speaking to implement many if not all of the elements of the 

Alewife District Plan into this Overlay.   

          Just for reference, this is the area that we're 

discussing.   

          Keep -- yeah --  

          And just a quick review of the timeline, so, you 

know, Envision was a two-year effort. The Alewife District 

plan came out in the fall.  We submitted the original 

petition in August.  We had two hearings with this Board 

ending in December.   

          Since then, we've worked with CDD staff and some 

of the neighborhood groups towards revising this petition, 

and here we are with our revised petition.   

          We got delayed by -- we actually submitted the 

original petition in March, but then COVID kind of pushed

things out, so we resubmitted in July and here we are. 

          So as an agenda, we're just going to go point by 

point to the seven comments that this Board had in our 

responses, and then acknowledge two key clarifications in 

the CDD memo.  There were a couple of other comments that 

they had, but we were mostly in agreement and just wanted to 

clarify two main points.  But we can move forward. 

          Sorry, keep going. 

          So the seven comments -- the first one related to 

Master Plan.  We're implementing a Master Plan review 

process.  The second comment was to tie the petition much 

more explicitly to the Alewife District Plan.  

          There were some comments about how much of the 

ground floor needed to be Light Industrial uses.  There were 

some neighborhood concerns about rooftop mechanical 

equipment.  There were some comments regarding parking 

minimums, maximums.  There were some comments regarding 

implementing increased tree canopy and open space, and 

lastly to take a look at how this petition would not only 

impact our property, but the remaining properties.   

          So we'll start with Master Plan review.  So the 

first comment was to create a very clear and delineated 

66

Master Plan review process, that is explicitly written into 

the zoning text.  During our last hearing, this was 

something that was considerably discussed during the 

hearing.   

          We indicated that it was always our intent to do 

this.  It kind of served -- it was a mutual desire to have 

this process play out.  We referenced Discovery Park as 

somewhat of an analogy. 

          And since then, we've worked with CDD to create a 

new section 20.95.52, that in a lot of ways mimics a PUD 

process, and I think was grabbed from the process that was 

implemented over in Kendall Square.   

          So we can certainly answer questions about the 

specifics, but, you know, overall we now have a very 

specific process that is outlined in the petition very 

explicitly for review.   

          Very similarly in terms of the Alewife District 

Plan, before there was more general language regarding 

conformance to the District plan, and now there is very 

specific references to the plan.  I'm sure this Board is 

familiar with the plan, but there are several sections.   

          And now the Board -- you can go to the next slide 

67

11

12

13

14

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

-- now the Board, you know, makes it very clear that the 

Planning Board will need to make a specific finding that any 

proposal under this petition specifically is in conformance 

with each section of that plan.  And again, we can go into 

specifics later, but -- 

          So Light Industrial uses -- keep going, please -- 

the comment was that given how important Light Industrial 

and consumer-based business were to the Alewife District 

Plan in providing a home from those types of tenants, that 

they really wanted to make sure that that was a significant 

element of the proposals, and this Board was contemplating 

putting a percentage of -- you know, perhaps over 50 percent 

of the ground floor would be used for these types of uses. 

          The petition takes a slightly different approach, 

although we're certainly open to alternate language.  But we 

use the term --quote, unquote-- used predominantly.   

          And you can go to the next slide. 

          This is a representative example of how -- this is 

actually one of the buildings that we're contemplating -- an 

example of how we think that Light Industrial uses might fit 

into this plan.  And the only thing that we wanted to 

clarify is that house spaces, utilities, bikes, lobby or 

68

circulation areas, loading, that those would be carved out 

from what is required.   

          Obviously, every building has elements of the 

building that need to be on the first floor to serve the 

upper floors, and so as long as those spaces are allowed, 

you know, we think that this -- you know, we're certainly 

open to discussing what language makes sense.  But that's -- 

the language that's firmly in position uses the term, 

"predominantly" except for these other types.   

          Rooftop mechanical equipment, this is actually a 

comment from the neighborhood, and in particular the 

Highlands neighborhood.  You know, understanding that these 

mechanical spaces in particular for lab uses can be, you 

know, 325 feet, depending on, you know, the specifics of the 

building.  And so, there were some questions about how the 

rooftop mechanical equipment would get screened. 

          What the petition does is reference the urban 

recommendations that speak generally to reducing visual bulk 

and building massing.   

          There isn't a specific section in the Alewife 

District Plan, at least in terms of my read of it, that 

references rooftop mechanicals.  But there's certainly a lot 

69

22

of language regarding reducing the bulk, reducing the 

massing, making sure that there are breaks in the façade and 

other types of design guidelines. 

          And so, what the petition does is references this 

section as well as every other section in the Alewife 

District Plan and asks that -- and requires that the Board 

make a specific finding that the buildings are designed in 

conformance to those guidelines. 

          The other thing I'll note is I know that elsewhere 

in the city there are some guidelines, depending on where 

properties are located in respect to how those mechanicals 

are screened.  And so, we would certainly conform with all 

the existing guidelines, as would be applicable to this 

project or any project.  

          In terms of parking -- keep going -- so we can 

talk about this later in the clarification section as well.  

Parking and traffic obviously is a hot button in this area.  

The CDD memo and this Board had indicated to recommend 

stricter parking requirements, enhanced TDM measures and 

other public infrastructure, such as buses and bridges. 

          So this petition specifically eliminates parking 

minimums, as I know that that was kind of a catch point.

22

          And then also, like I keep mentioning, the Board 

would have to make a specific finding that the project is 

consistent with the Mobility sections of the Alewife 

District Plan.  That's pages 124 and 133.  And I can touch 

on parking at the end.  Keep going. 

          Again, so just to kind of continue with this 

theme, the Board asks for clearer expectations for tree 

canopy for permeable area, publicly useable open space.  And 

again, the Board would have to make a finding that the 

project is consistent with the climate and environment 

sections within the Alewife District Plan.   

          It's worth noting that that section includes not 

only stuff about permeable area and open space, but also 

about flood resilience and other similar measures that would 

all need to be in conformance with the plan, and -- again -- 

happy to talk about those during a Q&A. 

          All of these kinds of things would get looped into 

the Board's finding under each one of these sections within 

the Alewife District Plan for any project. 

          The last piece of this was that the Board take a 

look at the assessment of how other properties in the AOD 

plan would be impacted, given that this was an Overlay

District petition, and not simply limited to our properties. 

          So what we did is we took inventory -- I think 

these slides might be familiar to this Board, as we had put 

these up on the screen last time; you can keep going. 

          We put together a simple kind of land use map 

together.  The purple is the 12 acres that Cabot, Cabot & 

Forbes owns.   

          Directly to the south, what's labeled as 

industrial condos is a property known as 67 Smith Place.  We 

-- CC&M actually have that property under contract, and are 

scheduled to close relatively shortly. 

          And the current plan is to keep that property in 

its current use, in coordination with the city and some 

other tenants, but to repurpose that existing building + or 

-.  To the east, where it's labeled as an office, that's 

actual part of The Davis Companies lab proposal.  So that 

property is spoken for.  That's a three-story building, a 

proposed three-story building. 

          And then further south we have the Soulton's 

(phonetic) property, the West Cambridge Science Park, some 

lab office space, and then some miscellaneous warehouse and 

industrial tenants.

          So what we did was we said, "What's the practical 

nature of the buildings and ownership?  And what we found is 

that, you know, the Soulton's -- the West Cambridge Science 

Park and properties to the south of that are really the only 

ones that are, you know, --quote, unquote-- "up for grabs" 

just given what the ownership is and what the proposal are 

in this area. 

          So if you go to the next slide, please? 

          When you layer on the additional height 

restrictions that remain intact with this petition, we're 

really talking about a relatively small area.   

          So starting where the letter "P" is and 

"Q,R,W,X,Y,Z and then A1, those are kind of the areas that 

would be subject in a practical manner -- of being subject 

to that 85-foot-height limit for commercial uses, provided 

that those proposals, if any, in the future, would be 

contributing towards this bridge or future bridges, moving 

forward connecting the Quadrangle and Triangle.   

          So relatively small area of potential height 

increases, given the overall -- or I should say potential 

unknown, you know, to be proposed projects that would 

benefit from this petition.

          And so, the last part of this presentation, then I 

can wrap up for Q&A, and I apologize for the text heaviness 

of the next two slides, but we want to focus on two 

comments; the first was the bridge and the second was 

parking.   

          So switch to the next slide.   

          The CDD memo basically flagged this section and 

said, you know, we'd like to further discuss this.  And they 

certainly are -- certainly would encourage that.  What I 

want to do with this slide and the next slide is just 

clarify our intent.   

          And, you know, to the extent that language wants 

to be tweaked or this Board has any comments, you know, we 

would of course welcome that feedback. 

          But we just want to clarify the intent.  So what 

the petition does is say that FAR bonus is 0.25 bonus over 

the lot area of a project under this petition is achievable 

by either the construction of the bridge or the design of 

buildings incorporating the bridge's structural elements or 

the conveyance of property interests, or the contribution 

of--quote, unquote-- "significant funds." 

          So our intent here was actually not to be super 

74

12

22

vague; our intent here was to create a mechanism whereby 

this Board and the Planning Staff can make a finding that 

future development proposals, whether it be in our 12 acres 

or below, or the --, you know, any other properties that 

wish to contribute in the way that they are able to 

contribute given the locations of their properties and size 

of their projects -- that they can contribute towards the 

bridge, either this bridge or future bridges to the east, in 

addition to -- you know, the initial construction, but also 

the operating and ongoing capital maintenance that could be 

required moving forward. 

          So not all properties, obviously, are abutting the 

MBTA tracks, so not all properties are able to -- you know, 

design buildings that incorporate those elements into -- you 

know, the structural elements into the design. 

          And then in terms of contributing the significant 

funds, again we just wanted to create a mechanism where 

let's say, you know, the West Cambridge Science Park wants 

to propose a building in a few years, and at that time the 

city is contemplating a new bridge further east, and they 

want to put up, you know, whatever it is, however much money 

that they think is appropriate, and to get that FAR bonus as

a trade for that contribution -- that was the mechanism that 

we were trying to create with this proposal. 

          So I just wanted to clarify that.  And again, this 

language I'm sure will be vetted and tweaked and pushed and 

pulled a little bit.  But I just, again, wanted to clarify 

our text.  So that's on the bridge piece. 

          And then the last piece before I wrap up is on 

parking.  So there are a couple comments on parking.  One 

was not only to eliminate the parking minimums, which we 

did, but also to establish parking maximums.   

          The other comment was talking about asking about 

what the intended effect was to eliminate the max height of 

off-street parking facilities, and the third comment was to 

minimize urban heat island effect by contemplating 

landscaping or other kind of elements over the garage.   

          So what the petition does, it says -- we already 

discussed what the petition does.  The parking covering 

isn't specifically mentioned, but kind of included generally 

by reference overall into the Alewife District Plan.   

          And again, in terms of our intent, we want to 

provide the Traffic Department as well as this Board and 

others within the city the opportunity to determine the

appropriate parking, given the uses, and particular the 

ground-floor uses that, depending on what that consumer-

basic business is, could require some parking, maybe that 

would necessitate more parking then if those uses weren’t 

there. 

          And the other thing there's a wide range of those 

types of uses on the ground floor just to have that 

flexibility built into. 

          And the other piece was, you know, this petition 

obviously contemplates a bridge.  That bridge isn't built 

yet.  Potentially in the future there could be other bridges 

further to the east.   

          And so, when a proposal comes forward, you know, 

we want to make sure that the parking is adequate for the 

level -- the amount of public infrastructure and mobility 

options that are in place as of the time of this project, 

that those projects are envisioned to be completed.   

          So those were kind of the elements saying why we 

might not want to have a parking maximum at this point. 

          And then in terms of the comment of eliminating 

the height of the off-street parking facility, admittedly 

this might be a little bit too loose of a sentence in the 

77

petition, but the intent was a couple fold.   

          One was to incentivize centralized off-street 

parking, so that each specific use wouldn't have to have its 

own parking within its area, especially within a Master Plan 

project.   

          So to the extent that centralizing that parking 

would require that that garage be above whatever that height 

limit is, we want this Board to make the determination that 

it was appropriate, given the overall context of the 

development. 

          The other piece -- a little bit more technical, 

and something that we're continuing to study with our local 

counsel as well as the CDD, but on our specific plan, we 

have residential units that screen the garage, and that 

provide a kind of visual and use spot to that garage, which 

is otherwise up against the tracks. 

          And so we want to make sure that the height of 

that residential in front of the garage didn't govern how 

tall that garage could be in the back.   

          It was unclear to us how that building as a whole 

might be categorized from the use perspective, or if it was 

multiple uses.  So again, it's maybe more of a drafting 

78

thing.   

          And then on the last piece, we agree that 

landscaping and solar should certainly be considered and 

encouraged, incentivized for the tops of these parking 

facilities.   

          But again, and maybe I'm not as familiar with some 

of the zoning texts elsewhere in the city, but how those 

additional elements on top of the garage are treated from a 

height perspective.  We didn't want to limit the height of 

the overall garage.   

          So if there are solar carports above the garage, 

we wouldn't want that to get -- you know, reduce the amount 

of spaces in the garage because of that height. 

          So that might not be applicable given the language 

of the zoning ordinance, but those were kind of how we were 

thinking about those comments.   

          So with that, I will wrap up, and pause for 

questions.  Thank you for your time very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  We 

are actually going to turn to public comment.  This is a 

public hearing, so any members of the public who wish to 

speak should now click the button that says, "Raise hand."

If you are calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by 

pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had received 

one written communication on this petition from a group 

called, "The Cambridge Islands Quad Committee."  Written 

communications received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday will also 

be entered into the record. 

          Okay.  I will now ask Staff to unmute the speakers 

one at a time.  You should begin by saying your name and 

address, and Staff will confirm, then, that we can hear you.  

After that you'll have up to three minutes to speak before I 

ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  This is Jeff Roberts with 

Community Development again.  The first speaker is Matt 

D'Amico.  You can unmute yourself and speak.  Please begin 

by saying your name and giving your address. 

          JAY DOHERTY:  I think that's an error.  He's 

actually a CC&F person.  I don't think he's trying to speak 

right now.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  I will move on, then, to the 

next hand that's raised, which is John Chun.  You can unmute 

yourself, John Chun, and give your name and address.

          JOHN CHUN:  Hello, good evening.  My name is John 

Chun from 48 Loomis Street, Cambridge.  So I'm part of the 

Cambridge Highlands Committee, which, as you indicated, 

submitted a letter yesterday to the Planning Board.   

          And so starting out, we still find some ambiguity 

in the current petition, and I know the CDD has done an 

excellent job of analyzing the current petition, so I'm not 

going to repeat much of what has already been presented in 

the memo. 

          But one thing we do like to ask is, as indicated 

in the memo by the CDD, we like to ask the Planning Board to 

require the city, the Staff to revise the current petition 

text for clarity and consistency before the Planning Board 

recommends adoption of the petition. 

          And also, the Highland Quad Community has been 

reaching out to the CC&F, and we are very much willing to 

work with them, and we're -- again, not against any 

development, but we'd just like to make this outcome of this 

development something that the whole neighborhood can enjoy 

for many decades to come. 

          On that matter, we submitted a letter with our 

request.  There were 11 points in the letter to the City 

81

Council on May 14.   

          And we also sent a copy over to CC&F.  At the 

time, CCYF acknowledged the receipt, and also indicated that 

they would reach back out to us in about a month of time. 

          However, we did not get to meet with the CC&F 

until last week, when we reached out to them upon finding 

out about this public -- this Planning Board meeting, and 

only at that time we were able to meet with the CC&F.   

          We would like to see more proactive outreach and 

engagement by the CC&F as they are working with the 

neighborhood organizations. 

          And with the remaining time, I'd like to just go 

over as much of the 11 points that we submitted to the City 

Council, and also, to the letter to you in our letter 

yesterday.   

          The first point that we made was to require a 50-

foot-wide no-build green zone between abutting residential 

property lines and the development that the CC&F is 

proposing, as well as many other areas within the AOD-1.  

And that is also called out by the Alewife -- the Alewife 

Plan.  So I think it is something that we all should be 

considering.

          A second point that we made was to include the -- 

an increased 85-foot limit.  We wanted that to include the 

four-foot elevation for the flood control, as well as the 

mechanicals at the rooftop.  Therefore, we'd like to have 

those heights be reduced and up to 85 feet, including all 

the other elements. 

right here.  Thank you.    

          And as I'm running out of time, I'd like to stop 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Chun, just going 

to hold for a minute.  Do any Board members have an 

objection to Mr. Chun just quickly finishing the list of 

requests from the letter?  I'm seeing some thumbs up, some 

nodding. 

          Mr. Chun, if you would quickly -- but, you know, I 

think the Board is interested in hearing what the community 

has to say.  We've obviously seen the letter, so you don't 

need to go into a great deal of detail, but we're supportive 

of getting that information on the record.         

          JOHN CHUN:  Great.  Thank you so much, Madam 

Chairman.  So I'll continue.  I'll skip some of these, and 

also some of these may not be relevant for the Planning 

Board, so I won't be getting into too much detail here.

          But the next point that I'd like to make is about 

Blair Pond Reservation.  It is something that is dear to all 

of us in the Highlands neighborhood, so we'd just like to 

make sure that we work with the CC&F in making sure that's 

preserved, and also, developed into an area that everyone 

can enjoy.   

          The next point I'd like to make is just calling 

for an independent hydrology study.  And again, I think that 

is something that is being called out by some of the members 

of the Planning Board, as well as CDD.  So I won't be 

getting into too much detail. 

          And another point that we made was an independent 

shadow study.  Again, that is something that you have also 

called out before as well. 

          And another point we made was just ask CC&F to 

work the neighboring associations to just define some of 

these amenities around the bridge and the mode of 

transportation of the bridge, et cetera.   

          So some of the details around the bridge and how 

that's going to be used, and the access.  So I think that's 

something that we'd like to have some input to that design. 

          The next one is really property management.  That

is really something -- some details that we'd like to work 

with CC&F, to make sure that the property is being managed, 

and the other neighbors are being considered in the 

decisions.   

          And the ninth point was just a site planting 

imagined plan.  Again, some of the green space that we 

already talked about, so that is something that we called 

out for in the letter.   

          And the tenth point was just to encourage 

homeownership.  I know there's going to be a lot of rental 

units in the residential units that CC&F is proposing, but 

we also believe that the homeownership does add to the 

makeup of the neighborhood, and also some long-term goodwill 

of the neighborhood as well.   

          So we'd like to see some homeownership, whether it 

is low-income homeownership or regular, middle-income 

homeownership, that's something we'd like to see. 

          And the last point that we made was that the 

zoning language may not capture all the specifics and 

details.  So one thing we asked for was there should be a 

signed letter of understanding -- LOU -- between the city 

and the CC&F, so that there could be something in writing 

85

that can protect us, aside from just the zoning language 

itself.  So that's really all we have.  Thank you so much 

for the extra time.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So that was the only hand that was 

-- this is Jeff again -- that was the only hand that was 

raised at this time, so I will lower that hand.  If there 

are -- I'll repeat the instructions for anybody that's 

listening and still wants to speak.  Please push the button 

that says, "Raise hand" on Zoom at this time.   

          If you're participating by phone and would like to 

speak, please press *9 on your phone, and I'll give folks a 

few seconds to figure out how to do that, if they're still 

wanting to speak.   

          So it doesn't appear that anyone else is raising 

their hand.  So at this point, I will turn it back over to 

the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We'll now 

move from public comment to Board discussion.  If we're to 

continue this to a future date and have new information, 

there will be another opportunity for public comment on the 

new information.   

          So Board members, we have received a memo from CDD 

staff who are available for questions.  Do Board members 

have any questions for the petitioner's representatives or 

86

for Staff?     

          [Pause] 

          All right.  If there are no questions, we'll go to 

discussions then.  Let's see.  Who shall I start with?  I 

will start with --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Sorry to the --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh!     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- Chair.  I think Ted -- I saw on 

my screen that Ted raised his hand, his actual hand and not 

his virtual hand, so --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY: [Laughter] Not his 

virtual hand.  Okay.  Ted, please, go ahead.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm sorry.  For some reason, my 

unmute wasn't working.  Well, I have some questions to start 

with.  There's a lot of language in here that is very 

unclear, and I'd like to be sure that I understand the 

intent of all of it.

          If I start out with a section -- first section  

"209551," it references, "The building's ground floor will 

use predominantly by Light Industrial uses and/or consumer-

facing businesses, as those uses are defined in the Alewife 

Plan."  

          I have searched through the Alewife Plan and done 

a computer search of it too, and there are no definitions of 

either Light Industrial uses or consumer-facing businesses.  

So I don't know what is intended to be included 

specifically, and I think that needs to be made clearer.   

          And if somebody wants to say that I am wrong, and 

that they are defined somewhere, I'd be happy to look for 

that. 

          So I guess that’s sort of the question.  I guess 

my other comments are really about what I think of the whole 

thing in its entirety.  But I do also want to make sure it's 

clear that the language regarding the height floor elevation 

is also unclear, but it appears to say that the building 

height could be up to 89 feet, and that's before we then add 

the penthouse on top of that.   

          And certainly I'm unclear on what the last line of 

that section is about subsequently enacted citywide flood

rezoning standards, how they expect this to all work 

together. 

          I guess an overriding question I have is -- which 

was raised last time and still is unanswered -- as to why is 

this a special Master Plan zoning rather than a PUD that 

we've used -- the city has used successfully in a lot of 

other locales?  Hopefully you'll come back to me later for 

discussion?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, no I'll 

definitely come back to you later for discussion.  I think 

those are good questions, and if we could hear from the 

applicant thoughts on those before we move back to Board 

discussion, that would be great.      

          JACOB VANCE:  So, Ted, thank you for your 

questions.  In terms of the first question, I think we agree 

that some of the definitions are a little unclear in the 

Alewife District Plan, in terms of what those Light 

Industrial and similar consumer-facing businesses are. 

          The two pages that we were looking at were pages 

80 and 81 of the Alewife District Plan.  It describes Light 

Manufacturing and Light Industrial use.  It has an example 

photo; I think it's Anderson & McQuaid it looks like, the

moulding company.   

          And then on the next page, on A92, it talks about 

consumer-facing businesses in, "Light Industrial spaces" and 

there's a representative picture of Central Rock Gym, who as 

we've told you in the past is our tenant, and we're hoping 

to try to retain in the eventual project.   

          But I agree those -- you know, it's not like 

there's a list of 50 bullets of what those types of uses 

could be.  I think the general intent as we understood it 

was low barrier to entry jobs -- you know, wide open spaces, 

tall floor ceiling heights, and not -- and specifically not 

kind of these national chains or other types of uses that, 

you know, you can find anywhere in the city.   

          I think as we understood it, the intent of this 

area of the plan was to provide a home for these types of 

uses that didn't really have uses elsewhere.  But we're 

certainly open to -- you know; however you want to define 

that.  I think our intent is consistent with -- at least we 

tried to be consistent with how this is shown in the plan.  

          Yeah, and then again, you know, as Jay was just 

saying, you know, when we go into a special permit process, 

when any proponent goes into a special permit process, they

apply for specific uses within the Use Table.  And it would 

be up to this Board to make a finding that those uses are 

consistent with what the intent of the Alewife District Plan 

was to qualify for that height. 

          So that's kind of how we envisioned it working.  

But, again, if there is a more refined list, I would be 

happy to incorporate that. 

          And then in terms of the height, the concept of 

excluding the four-foot, or it's not -- not to exceed four 

feet, but to prop the first-floor elevation up by a maximum 

of four feet for flood resiliency -- that concept came from 

the Alewife District Plan, and so we grabbed that concept as 

well, because this area, as we all know, is subject to 

flooding. 

          And, you know, I think not to speak on behalf of 

CDD and the plan, but I think the idea was to not 

necessarily penalize proponents looking to plan for 

resilient buildings; that we're responsible to the most 

current standards. 

          And the comment about, you know, whatever the most 

-- the kind of catch-all comment that you caught here about 

whatever the most current standard was in the future, 

91

perhaps Jeff can speak more to that.   

          But I believe the intent was that this is an 

ongoing study, and that best practices in five, 10 years 

from now might not be best practices today in terms of 

whatever the 2070 storm surge sea level rise elevation is.  

Maybe that's a different standard that's best practices in 

the future. 

          And so, to have that be -- to have a little bit of 

flexibility to adhere to whatever the most current thinking 

is I think was the intent there, Ted. 

          And then in terms of the PUD - 

          JAY DOHERTY:  With the underlying zoning, you have 

to -- the underlying zoning, Charles LeRay answered this 

question at the earlier hearings, and we can redocument it, 

but the underlying zoning of the area does not permit a PUD.

     So what we've tried to do is adopt the Board's intent 

in terms of creating a mechanism that does a very comparable 

function to PUD, in terms of requiring Master Plan and other 

elements.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, I see you 

have your hand up.  Oh, wait.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I feel like I should

-- so this is Jeff Roberts.  I feel like I should jump in, 

because some of these questions and the petitioner sort of 

indicated that, you know, that some of these issues were 

addressed when the petitioner was working with staff, and, 

you know, I do agree and it's sort of reflected in the CDD 

memo that some of the language may needed to be clarified. 

          But in terms of some of the intent, just to kind 

of go over the same items and just to give my perspective on 

it, the -- sort of the Light Industrial and consumer-facing 

issues, as indicated, there is a -- the plan doesn't provide 

an exact definition, so maybe the term, "definition is not 

necessarily the appropriate language.   

          But as with much of this, you know, petition, it 

makes reference to the objectives in the Alewife Plan, which 

are presented in a somewhat more descriptive way.   

          And the way that this type of zoning would work, 

if this were to come to the Planning Board for review, is 

that it would require that the Planning Board make a finding 

that whatever is being proposed and a development proposal 

would -- you know, specify what range of uses are actually 

being proposed for the development plan -- that the Planning 

Board would be in the position of making findings of whether

21

22

that's generally consistent with what the Alewife Plan 

envisions.  And that's -- it is similar to the way that the 

PUD zoning is handled in many parts of the city. 

          In terms of the flood resilience, I just wanted to 

note that -- in terms of that last piece about subsequently 

enacted flood resilience standards -- from the Staff 

perspective, we want to make sure that whatever zoning gets 

adopted, if anything gets adopted forth particular area, 

doesn't conflict with any broader citywide standards that 

might be enacted in the future related to flood resilience, 

as you know Ted Berg (phonetic) in the city is working on 

Climate Preparedness and Resilience zoning recommendations. 

          And we wouldn't want -- while in some ways the 

zoning for this area may need to take some additional issues 

into consideration, or the issues may be different in 

character than in other parts of the city, we wouldn't want 

-- you know, we wouldn't want to be ignoring any standards 

that get applied citywide. 

          So that's the -- and again, the language could be 

clarified and staff would be happy to assist in finding a 

way to do that. 

          As to the PUD zoning, I think that's a question 

94

that I struggle with myself a bit.  There are certain things 

in the Article 12 PUD procedures that can be somewhat sort 

of cumbersome; may not be perfectly tailored to a situation 

such as this one.   

          On the other hand, if it is a part of the zoning 

that exists and has been applied in many other areas I think 

it could be, you know, used as the -- procedurally, this 

isn't necessarily a PUD zoning district, but procedurally 

the exact same Article 12 procedures could be followed if a 

development plan were proposed, you know, covering a lot of 

area and utilizing some of the provisions in the zoning.   

     But there are other places in the city also where think 

of master plan zoning, you know, outside of the specific PUD 

standards and procedures has been used. 

          So it could go either way.  And we're happy to try 

to work on refining the language however the Planning Board 

wants to recommend.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Yeah, thank 

you for that clarification, Jeff.  Lou, you had had your 

hand up previously.  Do you have questions?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I wonder if -- and I 

don't know who will field it -- 209552 Section 2, "Review

Criteria" can someone go over A, B and C and give a little 

explanation?  I'm curious how that had come about?   

          JACOB VANCE:  So are you on Site Development Plan, 

Site Massing Plan, Parking and Loading Plan?   

          It has that's what you're referring to.  Yeah, on 

this one we were working with CDD to get the components of 

this Master Plan special permit, and Jeff was very helpful 

to reference.   

          I believe, Jeff, it was the section of the zoning 

that was recently enacted in Kendall Square, if I'm 

remembering correctly, where the components of the Master 

Plan, where the PUD actually in this case, were required.  

And so, this is basically a copy and paste of that language.   

          I believe it was in Kendall Square, Jeff -- and 

please correct me if I'm wrong -- where these were the 

components of the proposal that was required under that 

zoning.  And so, again, kind of mimicking this PUD concept 

to include them in a Master Plan process.  But perhaps Jeff, 

you have some further insight on this?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Sure.  This is Jeff Roberts again.  

So the -- I'll kind of walk back and try to talk sort of 

briefly, but try to be a little bit thorough.  The concept

of a Master Plan has been -- or a Master Plan type of 

permitting has been in zoning for a while.   

          And the concept is that -- so for a lot of 

development where someone is seeking a special permit or 

some kind of development review, you have, you know, a plan 

-- a building plan, where there's architectural drawings and 

designs and everything's sort of drawn out as it's going to 

be built.   

          The Master Plan approach is more of a middle-level 

special permit review where the Planning Board might grant a 

special permit for a large area that has, you know, multiple 

building sites with open space and public improvements and 

streets and, you know, sidewalks and various elements that 

are all part of a whole. 

          And the review process tends to have sort of 

multiple steps to it, where the Planning Board starts by 

approving the plan and approving, you know, what development 

is allowed on each site in terms of the uses, the scale, the 

height, the square footage. 

          And then each of those individual sites gets 

broken down, and each one might be subject to its own Design 

Review process after the special permit is granted.  And the

special permit allows for the project to be phased over 

time.   

          With a normal special permit, you know you have to 

act on it within two years, and you have to start 

construction, and then you have to kind of, you know, 

complete construction, you know, on the whole project in 

found herself. 

          So the idea behind the master plan is that you 

have this larger area that you get to review.  But this was 

several years I think we were -- maybe five years ago -- we 

were working on the zoning for the Volpe site, and realized 

that the language that we had in the zoning at the time was 

somewhat vague in terms of what actually constituted a 

Master Plan submission.   

          And so, you know, Staff worked on trying to lay 

out what are the different elements that should be included 

in a Master Plan developed proposal.  And that ultimately 

got incorporated into the zoning for the Volpe site.   

          It was adopted in 2017, and it's been incorporated 

into other areas of zoning for other areas too, like the 

PUD-8 District, which was the Cambridgeside rezoning.  Used 

that same sort of framework of the development proposal has

a bunch of different plan elements to it.   

          The Planning Board would review those plan 

elements, approve kind of a Master Plan special permit, and 

the conditions of that special permit would lay out the kind 

of phasing of the project and how each individual element of 

the project would have to come forward for its own Design 

Review.   

          So that's the concept.  And it's sort of been 

tweaked a little bit.  I think different development 

proposals in different areas that are meant to achieve 

different goals might have, you know, different elements 

too, so, you know, it's possible that in this scenario there 

might be certain elements of the plan that might be 

included, you know, here in Alewife that maybe wouldn't be 

included in Kendall Square or vice versa.  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Jeff, I guess I'm getting a 

little more specific.  Under the Review criteria, the first 

set, that there will be able to share GFA across multiple 

lots, b) front yard setback requirements of the underlying 

zoning district shall not apply.   

          Also the next one, c) is no height requirements -- 

no maximum height for parking?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Right, so again, this is some -- 

this is a provision that sort of tracks with PUD zoning.  So 

normally you would have -- if you have, you know, individual 

development sites, they would all be subject to dimensional 

requirements like setbacks and, you know, parking.  Each 

would have its own set of requirements.   

          Under a Master Plan, the -- instead of having 

specific requirements, the Planning Board through the review 

and approval process would establish what the required 

setbacks and parking and, you know, other kind of 

dimensional characteristics of each site would be.  And that 

would be based on in this case, you know, comparing the 

development proposal to the recommendations of the Alewife 

District Plan. 

          So that's the intent.  I do -- you know, agree, 

kind of going back to some of the comments from our memo, 

there are areas in which that aspect of the zoning language 

could be clarified or improved. 

          But the idea is that the -- it's the Planning 

Board that gets to determine what the -- you know, what the 

setbacks are, for example, rather than the -- kind of the 

underlying zoning, which might have, you know, stricter

setback requirements that might not really make sense in the 

context of looking at a large Master Plan with multiple 

building sites across a large area. 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I guess my only 

concern is where it says, "Maximum height of off-street 

parking facilities shall not apply." So do we have the 

flexibility to change that?  Is that what you're saying?  It 

seems like we'd be fighting out of a corner.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, just speaking to our memo -- 

and I shouldn't be remiss to point out that Sarah Scott from 

my team did sort of the lion's share of work on this and 

actually sort of identified that part as something that -- 

you know, we identified in our memo as being -- us being 

somewhat unsure about.   

          Because there really isn't a -- there's not a 

maximum height of off-street parking facilities in zoning.  

You know, the structure of parking is subject to the height 

requirements of any building in -- within a zoning district.  

          So, you know, our expectation is that any 

structured off-street parking would be subject to the same 

height requirements as any other building.   

          And so, it's not -- it wasn't entirely clear to 

101

us, and I think the -- and the CC&F representatives can talk 

about this again, but in their presentation, I think they 

indicated that the concern was that they didn't want the 

parking height to be limited to something less than what was 

allowed for buildings in the area?   

          And if that’s the case, I don't know if that 

necessarily needs clarification in the zoning, but it's 

certainly something we can discuss, and as long as the 

intent is clear, we can write the language to make it work.     

          JACOB VANCE:  Yeah, thank you Jeff.  You know, 

just on that point to reiterate the last slide of the 

presentation, you know, this wasn't a -- I think Jeff 

characterized it very well.   

          We just didn't want, you know, the height to be a 

limiting factor in terms of a) supply and parking, b) having 

kind of solar and other kind of additional structural 

elements on top of the garage limit the height of that 

          And then c) we want to incentivize, you know, 

shared parking and cost triggered parking in a centralized 

garage.   

location. 

          You know, I don't think that we'd ever -- no one,

I don't think, would ever want to build more than a seven-

level garage anyways.  So I think that, you know, having the 

height of the garage be tied to the tallest building or 

whatever the tallest structure is, the commercial height 

limit, I think is more than adequate for the intent.  Sorry 

for any confusion on that point.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I guess this is for Jeff.  

I don't quite understand what this Board is supposed to be 

doing with this right now, because you've been saying the 

intent is [this], and CCF is saying, "Well the intent is 

[this]" but the language doesn't say that.   

          And so, if we as the Planning Board are suppose 

make a recommendation to the Ordinance Committee and to the 

City Council as to this particular -- the language in this 

particular proposal, you know, how in the world can we do 

that?   

          There are so many questions.  There are so many 

places where the language simply does not suggest what 

you're saying the intent is.  For example, I could easily 

argue that a future Planning Board with this language could 

authorize 150- or 200-foot parking garage.  There is nothing

in here that says that it's going to be subject to the 

maximum height in the underlying district. 

          And so, you know, it can't possibly be that we're 

going to be asked to make a recommendation today on this 

particular draft, because it cannot be viewed as anything 

more than a draft that we still have to raise all our other 

concerns about.  And so, I'm just trying to figure out right 

now what we're supposed to be doing.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Sure.  It's all a little bit of a 

difficult position to tell the Planning Board what you 

should be doing, but I'll tell you what -- I'll tell you 

what you can do, and just what -- and what we can do as 

staff.  So it's -- well I'll just preface by saying that I 

agree it's difficult and it becomes sort of a difficult kind 

of a circular, you know, loop where, you know, you try to 

interpret the intent based on the language, and then you -- 

          But then it's hard to understand -- if you don't  

-- you know, it's hard to make a recommendation on the 

language without understanding the intent, but then it's 

hard to make  a recommendation on the intent if you don't 

know the implications of the language. 

          For -- to kind of break that cycle, you know, we

22

try to always start with a very clear idea of what the 

intent is.  And I think that what we are hoping, at least on 

the staff level, that the Planning Board will kind of start 

by weighing in on is just the overall intent -- like what -- 

I think just as a -- at a broad level, I think that there's 

an understanding that the -- as presented, the intent is to 

modify the existing provisions in zoning in a way that will 

enable this type of -- you know, Master Plan development 

proposal to proceed. 

          And, you know, beyond that it's then a question 

for Planning Board of what should -- you know, what should 

or shouldn't the zoning do in order to, you know, enable 

that to proceed?   

          What are the -- what are the kinds of limitations 

and criteria that should be put in place in order to, you 

know, in order to do that if the Board is amenable to 

allowing that to proceed. 

          And, you know, the -- I think one of the -- just 

to highlight one of the key issues that we noted in our memo 

is this question of, you know, should the language of the 

zoning be somewhat more flexible, but rely on the Planning 

Board to make a more kind of general sort of holistic

judgment of whether a development proposal is in conformance 

with the Alewife District Plan..  or should the zoning 

incorporate more of the specific elements of the Alewife 

District Plan as requirements, which the -- you know, the 

Planning Board, there may be some flexibility allowing the 

Planning Board to, you know, to modify some of the 

requirements in certain ways.  But it would be -- you know, 

more specific as to what the requirements would be.   

          Those are the kind of questions of overall intent 

that would be helpful for the Planning Board to kind of 

opine on.  Certainly, we can -- you know, the Planning Board 

could make a recommendation, you know, laying out what the 

Board thinks the outcome of the petition should be, a and 

staff would work on language, or the Planning Board could 

ask Staff to -- you know, work on the language first, and 

then, you know, take a look at that before making a 

recommendation, like the first time that -- you know, the 

Board has -- this is the start of the hearing.   

          The City Council can, you know, can take action 

with or without the Planning Board's recommendation, but the 

Council has time to work on it as well, and to -- you know, 

consider what the Planning Board has to say.

          So that's -- I think the -- you know, what we're 

hoping to understand as a result of this discussion is, you 

know, if this petition were to have a favorable 

recommendation just in concept, then what would the -- you 

know, what would the Board recommend as the -- you know, 

what the zoning should actually do, what effect it should 

actually have.   

          And then we can -- you know, we can work on the 

language.  And it can come back to the Board, if that's the 

Board's preference.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  Many of the -- this is Jay Doherty 

of CC&F.  Many of the questions on the specificity of this, 

the idea we are seeking to understand is whether 

conceptually, and we've tried to be more specific in tying 

it to the Alewife District Plan -- the Board is in favor of 

this.  Because doing the bridge and admitting of this 

amenity area is a plan that could be done with these 

modifications to the AOD-1 zoning.   

          We always had the option, and still have the 

option, to pursue the Master -- pursue a special permit 

without these elements, but in doing so, those elements 

because of the lower height really deter us from the other

two -- that is getting the bridge done and installing this 

amenity. 

          So the special permit plan once we know the 

framework of the zoning, if the City Council and the 

Planning Board deem this too general and don't want to apply 

it, we'll continue under the existing zoning for the 

project.  We'll just continue without the benefit of this 

flexibility. 

          What we need to know is, is the concept of 

increased height tied to the development of the bridge, and 

tied to the creation of this type of usage to the extent we 

can codify it by referring to the Alewife District Plan is 

that generally okay?  It is the special permit that will 

provide many of the details that you would -- I otherwise 

normally like to know.   

          And we are hopeful -- what we tried to do in the 

interim between last year and this year is to try and tie 

the concept as much as possible with sub contexts that are 

provided in the Alewife District.   

          But when we come back to our for a special permit, 

we need to come back to you with either the feature of the 

additional height in place, or we need to change our

development plan and proceed under the existing.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  Yeah, and the last thing I would 

mention is, you know, this technology -- this is a 

substantially different petition than was originally filed 

last year.  There's a lot, lot more detail, a lot more 

thought behind it.  And I definitely give credit to Jeff and 

Sarah and the CDD team in terms of helping us to kind of 

craft this language. 

          But by no means are we saying, you know, this is 

it, and, you know, certainly, you know, there is further 

clarification to be had.   

          And we would hope that CDID would continue, you 

know, working with us to refine this language to eliminate 

some of these uncertainties, in particular with some of 

these, you know, points like the height of the parking 

garage for example. 

          So, you know, I think some of these smaller tweaks 

to the language could certainly be worked on, and we would 

expect to work on those.   

          And to Jay's point, is this concept something that 

is worth recommending subject to those tweaks, or is it 

something that we should kind of pull back the reins on and

proceed under the existing zoning?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Iram?            

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  You know, I 

just wanted to note that -- and we have not -- I have not 

talked offline with Staff at all, so this may be something 

that Jeff thinks is not a good idea, but I'm going to throw 

it out there anyway -- which is that, you know, one of the 

points of discomfort that I seem to be sensing  is that 

there's so much open-endedness around the petition.   

          So -- but you could flip some of those aspects in 

a reverse direction.  So for instance, instead of saying 

that -- to the point that Lou raised, which is there is no 

height limit for parking, you could say that here's the 

height limit that applies to everything including parking, 

but in permitting the Master Plan, the Planning Board has 

the ability to waive that. 

          So it at least anchors it in a place where there's 

some level of predictability, and then you can deviate from 

that, so it doesn't feel completely open-ended.   

          So it may be that if we can hear from the Board 

and the proponent can hear from the Board, what are the 

points that makes sense, and what are the -- or what are the 

110

conceptual proposals that make sense, and what are the 

points of discomfort, more specifically?   

          Then certainly Staff can work with them to try to 

define then, and also, that I think will be helpful as part 

of the Board's recommendation to the Ordinance Committee, 

whichever -- whether the Board is approving -- I mean 

supporting a positive recommendation or not.   

          I think those would be helpful for the Ordinance 

Committee to understand that rationale behind it, like where 

are the points of pain, and where are the points of comfort? 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thanks for 

that.  I'm seeing some Board hands here.  Hugh, let's hear 

from you next.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.  I'm getting pretty 

tired of hearing arguments, rather than comments.  So I'm 

going to go to comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  My first comment is on the word, 

"predominantly" as in the ground story will be used 

predominantly by industrial uses and consumer-facing 

businesses.  So it's not a defined zoning term, and so in 

that case you go to the dictionary.  What the dictionary

says is something that's predominant is the most common in a 

system.   

          So for example, if you have a stained-glass 

window, and 25 percent of the glass is red, and no other 

color has as high a percentage, the predominant color is 

red.  Now, that doesn't really achieve what we're trying to 

achieve here.   

          And at the end of that paragraph in the Staff memo 

on page 19, there's a recommendation that we require and 

make a finding that the ground-floor is exclusively devoted 

to Light Industrial and consumer-facing businesses, as 

recommended in the Alewife District Plan, except to the 

extent accessory ground-floor spaces are necessary to serve 

other uses in the building. 

          With that I understand how that would be done.  

But -- and yeah, it's no guarantee what that percentage is 

going to be.  So I would recommend adopting that concept in 

the Staff.  I hope you can write in language that would say 

that as the city's resilience plans are updated, that our 

standards will follow them. 

          In the Master Plan development process, there's a 

series of bullets.  At the bottom of page 5, one of the

bullets is specifying that there should be a phasing plan.  

          And I think it would be wise to -- you know, we've 

done some large developments in the city, some of which have 

actually been completed.  And the market's other constraints 

caused changes in these plans.   

          And so, I think that it should be made clear in 

the zoning what constitutes a major amendment, what 

constitutes a minor amendment?  If that concept hits within 

this thing. Just saying that those are PUD concepts; perhaps 

they're not in the language, but I think we should consider 

that. 

          But I checked off all the other bullets, as 

they're making a lot of sense to me.   

          There's a paragraph about the height of parking 

facilities, which I wrote next to, "No!" I think the parking 

facility should follow the height rules for the distribution 

-- for the location it's in. 

          I still can't believe how that parking garage on 

Binney Street got approved and permitted; a huge, ugly 

parking garage overwhelming the residences next to it -- 

anyway.  I don't want -- I want to avoid that.   

          And maybe I should step back a moment and say I

think the general proposals are very sensible.  I think the 

tradeoff between getting the amenities we want to see 

against 30 feet of extra height is a great idea.   

          I think the illustrative, conceptual site plan 

that they presented to us in a previous hearing may -- is 

very convincing that it was doable, and we could achieve a 

lot of the results. 

          So my comments are within that context, that I 

think is in fact a pretty good plan.  But at the same time, 

we have in Ted Cohen someone who is extremely gifted in 

reading zoning language and finding the less clear things.  

And I think that we need to clarify the language in the 

places where it's been identified.   

          Now, I think the language, the concept around the 

various types of contributions that could be made that will 

qualify for the bonus for the bridge, that concept I think 

is correct.  Those are the right things; you just have to 

get the language up to date. 

          And there was a question at the end:  Does the 

Board support applying for the most incentives for 

commercial development throughout the AOD-1 District, given 

that the district plan recommends that the southern portion 

114

of the site is residential, even though it's not currently 

used, as the thing on the screen shows that it's commercial. 

          So I am thinking we should say whatever bonuses 

and incentives that are offered are for the uses that are in 

the Alewife Master Plan.  If it's supposed to be housing, 

then you get the bonuses of housing.  If it's supposed to be 

commercial, then you get it and you get commercial. 

          I don't think that affects the current petitioner, 

but I think that we shouldn't be providing incentives to do 

things that are not consistent with the plan.  And that's 

the end of my comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you, Hugh.  Steven Cohen, you had your hand up previously.  

Are you ready to comment on this as well?       

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, I guess I just have a few 

comments.  And I guess I'm contrary to what Hugh would wish.  

I guess I'm still on the general level.  I'll just give a 

few quick comments.   

          First of all, I guess I am having difficulty 

really getting a picture of what this built-out area will 

be.  You know, what's the total square footage that will be 

built?  How many employees will there be?  How many cars 

115

will be generated?   

          And that obviously is premature to a having 

specific plan at this point, but there ought to be some way 

to sort of generate a representative plan of what the whole 

built-out district would look like, and what it would mean 

in terms of traffic and personnel, and in general, building 

by building, as we go. 

          And, you know, who knows what the final product 

would be if we're doing it building by building?   

          That's one thought.  A second general thought is 

traffic and impact on Concord Ave, and especially left turns 

onto Concord Ave or from Concord Ave, and then of course the 

traffic impact when you get down to the roundabout.   

          And, you know, I think if we're talking about a 

rezoning and a new project, you know, it may seem premature 

I guess, but I think we should have a decent understanding 

of what the impact will be on traffic. 

          And then the one other issue is the bridge.  And I 

guess I'm not really clear where the bridge will be.  We've 

heard the possibility of having more than one bridge, and is 

it just a pedestrian bridge, or is it possible to have 

vehicular -- we're really finally at the point where we're 

116

looking at a serious project of some substantial size.   

          We should have a more specific understanding of 

where and what that bridge should be.  And I know that gets 

into other parties that we don't have perfect control over, 

but I just do think that that should be an important part of 

this conversation.              

          [Pause] 

          Have I lost you?    

that was me.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Oh.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I had lost you, so 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sorry about that.  

No, but I think your point is well taken.  Obviously, the 

Alewife District Plan looked quite a bit at the traffic for 

the district as a whole; how that breaks out with this 

particular zoning proposal hasn't been divvied out just yet, 

but. 

          Let's get some other comments from Board members.  

Corinne, do you want to comment on this zoning petition?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes, thank you.  So a lot of 

folks have already mentioned this, but first of all I do 

want to acknowledge and appreciate that there have been

improvements to this petition since the last iteration we 

saw in Nave (phonetic) et al.   

          However, I do not support a positive 

recommendation for this petition.  It seems to be to me a 

blatant attempt to get very lucrative special consideration 

for one developer in exchange for a bridge that the public 

could access.  And in this case, it is not convincing that 

the public gets more than it's giving up. 

          I also written comments from a member of the 

public that note that this petition feels sneaky in that the 

developer is submitting this petition as a citizen's 

petition rather than as a property owner.   

          This petition was presented tonight as if the 

intent and purpose is solely benevolent, and for community 

benefit.  The presentation offered that the petition's 

purpose is to build a bridge for the public and to allow for 

Light Industrial uses in the Alewife District Plan, and that 

those might create economic opportunity for a diverse range 

of businesses, including those that provide low barrier to 

entry jobs. 

          But as a reminder, CC&F could contribute to 

building a bridge connecting the Quadrangle without

organomegaly this zoning petition, and in fact as CC&F 

mentioned, a bridge could benefit tenants.  So a developer 

might wish to contribute the funds for a bridge as an 

attractive benefit for tenants and their employees.   

          CC&F has significant real estate holdings, and 

could afford to contribute to opportunities for diverse 

businesses, including those that provide low barrier to 

entry jobs by donations or by allocating below market rent 

in any of its Cambridge holdings.   

          I see no compelling benefit for the public to 

rewrite zoning to offer a FAR bonus as trade.  And to be 

very clear, the way that this is written, if I'm the 

property owner or the developer, as long as I put One Rock 

Gym or an REI or some other tall consumer-facing business on 

the first floor of my development alongside my lobby, bike 

parking and other lost space such as backup house space, I 

can almost double my GFA and almost double my profits. 

          If this does move forward with a positive 

recommendation, I want to note that as discussed on page 19 

of the CDD memo, and as my colleagues have already 

mentioned, the petition specifies that the ground story will 

be--quote, unquote-- "used predominantly by Light Industrial

uses and/or consumer-facing businesses," but it doesn't set 

a minimum area for percentage requirement. 

          So having this lever without a mandated percentage 

renders the benefit to the public pointless. 

          And in the presentation on the slide titled, 

"intent" I don't know, Swaathi, if we can show that slide?  

But it illustrated that the requirements as they are written 

in the current petition could be met with a very small 

amount of the first floor useable square footage as Light 

Industrial use.   

          So in concept, a Light Industrial space could be a 

machine shop that employs and trains underrepresented young 

scientists.  It could specifically fund training 

opportunities for residents at Fresh Pond Apartments, Finch 

Apartments, or really any of the neighbors who might 

benefit.  That could be a great thing to have in Alewife, 

and it could be built without demanding anything in return. 

          So to be very clear, the way that this is written 

with no mandated percentage or minimum area requirement and 

without specifying and defining uses, this petition simply 

allows a developer to get around the rules, and get almost 

twice as much square feet than other people get, by simply

renting a space on the first floor to a rock climbing gym/ 

          And then finally, I want to address some of the 

overarching issues raised by staff for the Board to 

consider.  One thing we're considering are what are the 

advantages of recommending an immediate zoning change, 

focused on this Alewife subdistrict, compared to the 

alternative, a more comprehensive rezoning?  I don't see an 

advantage.   

          We're asked to think about whether the Board 

supports applying proposed incentives for commercial 

development, given that the Alewife District Plan 

recommendations a portion transition to predominantly 

residential use in the future; I say no. 

          And then it also asks us to think about whether 

the proposed amendments to the current FAR bonus for a 

pedestrian bicycle rail crossing are sufficiently clear and 

supportive of the city's objectives.  But I do think that 

there's potential for unintended consequences, and it's not 

clear to me that it's supportive of the city's objectives 

there.  Those are my comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Corinne.  All 

right.  Tom?  I don't think we've heard from you on this one

yet tonight.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, I'm struck by just the 

nature of the process we're stuck in, that it's an atomized 

conversation -- we describe it as that; that petitions put 

forward, petitions expiring, a pandemic happening.   

          And so, there's an awful lot of distance between 

all of the conversations, notwithstanding even all of the 

conversations on an accelerated part of critical plan and 

concern, which was done within our citywide Master Plan that 

focused properly on this area of the city. 

          And so, there's been a lot of conversation.  And 

unfortunately, it's very hard to kind of string it all 

together in a logical way.  I would say, given that we were 

asked to opine on whether Planning Board discretion as 

framed by the Alewife District Plan was a methodology that 

was rational that could work.   

          And I'm actually -- I think it's a great idea, you 

know, that there's been proper planning and a process, and a 

public process and lots of input and it's documented in a 

very handsome, handsome book, albeit with all -- I defer 

absolutely to Ted that the language is not precise in that 

Planning document, because that’s not the nature of Planning

documents. 

          And we need to set out -- we need to do better in 

the language that we see before us in terms of defining 

exactly what the terms are and how we would make some of 

those judgments. 

          But as a process, I believe it to be a rational 

planning process, and a good process, which has had a lot of 

community input.  That happens to be my particular view on 

          The issue of the height of the parking came up 

tonight.  Absolutely, that was not the intent, that the 

parking be 200 feet high, but that's clearly one way in 

which that language could be interpreted by a subsequent 

it. 

Board. 

          So then the question comes back, "Are the 

incentives offered in here to the developer through the 

proposed zoning?"  Are they -- is there are public good 

that’s coming back to us that equates there?"  

          And I would again go back to the -- I would go 

back to the plan, the District plan, which had an idea about 

trying to produce a setup job, which is a kind of job which 

is rare in this community; and then furthermore suggesting

that the architecture and the dimensions of that particular 

type of building to be that high bay on that lower floor -- 

to be jacked up in order to avoid that inundation of 

floodwaters on that lower level. 

          And so, this zoning petition -- again, I'd say 

goes back to the very heart of what that illustration shows 

in that plan, in terms of what the goal was of that planning 

process.   

          So if we could get the language more precise, I 

know that Mr. Chung asked for the Staff to revise the 

language.  And I think at the very least before we could 

move it forward, it needs to be more finely drafted.  But 

that's where I am in this at this point.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, if I could get back to my 

comments.  And I don't want to harp upon the language -- you 

know, to make, what I want to say is that I think the basic 

concept underlying this is a good idea.  I think that area 

of Cambridge needs a lot of help, and I think the concept of 

giving additional height to provide for the light industry 

and the consumer-facing projects are good, and are in 

keeping with the Alewife District Plan and make sense.

          What I am trying to figure out for myself and ask 

other Board members -- as I read this, the additional, and 

maybe there should be no tradeoff for the FAR, the 

additional FAR, maybe they should simply be if you do this 

type of development, you know, it's allowed by a special 

permit under this Master Plan.   

          But we're being presented with something that 

seems to be premised upon the construction of the bridge at 

a particular location that I'm not really certain is where 

the city would prefer the bridge to be.  

          And, you know, maybe two bridges are fine, but 

we're being presented -- I believe, as I read the language -

- with the proposal that you could get additional FAR if you 

construct the bridge in this your preferred location, or if 

you incorporate structural elements into your building, 

which my recollection is we've already required that of 

other developers further down. 

          Or, you convey fee or an easement to the city that 

would prevent access to some future bridge, or you make a 

contribution of significant funds -- unspecified amount. 

          So while I am fine with the concept of additional 

FAR to allow this type of development, the question is, what

if anything should the city be seeking in return for this?  

And I'm curious what the other Board members think about it.  

          You know, if it was, we will build a bridge of not 

more than $20 million dollars -- whatever number -- you 

know, that's -- we know what the tradeoff is.  But this is a 

very amorphous proposed tradeoff, and we don't know what it 

is and when it will ever happen. 

          And so, I don't know, you know, maybe this is 

something where the City Council does their own mysterious 

negotiation, but we're being asked to make a recommendation, 

and I don't know how I feel about what the proposed 

tradeoffs are.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  This is exactly where we're 

victims of the atomized conversation in my opinion, because 

there were representations made by Mr. Doherty that he was 

the only developer that was in a position to get this done 

with the MBTA and there was structural analysis and all of 

that.   

          And so, there was a promise and a picture of a 

bridge the last time we discussed this, in my recollection.  

And that would be my expectation of that's a fair trade for 

additional FAR.  That's not how the language is precisely

written, as you point out, Ted, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'm pretty much the same.  

So what happens if they build out everything in this area, 

and golly gee, we couldn't provide the bridge.  So now 

there's $5 a square foot, is that what we're saying?  And 

this is what it seems to say.  As long as you make 

provisions, you'll be able to get the FAR, and then you're 

required to give the city $5 a square foot.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Doherty, I see 

you're raising your hand not virtually, but you happen to be 

in my field of view, so you're lucky enough that I can see 

you.  

          JAY DOHERTY:  I think a number of the questions 

are right on target, but I'd like to clarify a few things.  

First, none of the benefits of this zoning apply to the 

project we propose unless two things are approved by the 

Planning Board. 

          One, the bridges happen.  Two, the uses are the 

uses that the city and the Board want to see in order to 

create the kind of things envisioned in the Alewife District 

Plan.

          If those two elements are not present, the 

petition is not available for our use as a developer.  We 

could not, if those two elements are not present to your 

satisfaction, under our special permit process, which could 

include greater specificity that we've discussed in terms of 

how it's done and such, then the provisions don't apply. 

          It's a gating provision that the bridge and the 

proposed uses that yield the height -- both of those are to 

be accomplished to your satisfaction for these provisions to 

be live.   

          If you were to say that the bridge doesn't appear 

to us to be fully credible in terms of being accomplished, 

there's no provision here and there's no thought.  And I 

have a thought of swapping in $5 a square foot.  $5 a square 

foot is highly likely to be -- well, in any event, it's not 

-- that's not proposed here. 

          What the Planning Board would do pursuant to this 

zoning if it's put in place is add the special permit making 

judgments about the credibility in fulfilling the intent of 

the Alewife future plan in this zoning to gain the 

additional 30 feet in height.  That additional 30 feet in 

height allows two things:  It allows us to accommodate these 

128

22

kinds of uses, which almost universally require greater 

height.   

          If we build under the 55-foot existing commercial 

building height restriction -- remember residentials are 80 

feet -- then doing a 20-foot or 25-foot ground floor 

basically takes away the viability of doing the rest of the 

building -- for example, as a lab, it just doesn't work.  

You'd be able to build one or two stories, you wouldn't want 

to build a 25-foot tall neighborhood uses.  There would be 

no -- you couldn't do your buildings otherwise. 

          So it's a gating -- but it is a gating issue from 

the Planning Board's disposition under this zoning to make 

the judgment the uses are the uses that are being discussed 

in the Alewife District Plan, and that the bridge is 

[3:07:42 indiscernible]  

          So that is a premise of the zoning.  If you were 

to find that the ground floor of Building D had a set of 

proposed uses that did not match your interpretations, you 

would be justified in saying to us that it doesn't work.   

          Yes, I'm happy you've done the bridge, but this 

doesn't work.  This was intended for a set of amenities that 

are really amenities, not necessarily -- or Light Industrial

uses, not necessarily [3:08:14 indiscernible] or something.  

And that's understandable, and that's the intent. 

          So those two provisions are gating provisions to 

the use of zoning.  Those aren't placed to your satisfaction 

under the special permit, they don't count.   

          Quickly secondly --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Doherty, if I 

could just to move the conversation along here: I think what 

you're encountering because it's -- you know, you say 

they're gating provisions in that the Planning Board would 

need to make special findings, or special permit findings 

that the project satisfies those. 

          Once you've gotten to the point where you are 

before us for a special permit finding, the Planning Board 

is put in a sometimes difficult position of saying, "Well 

why is the bridge -- you know, credible under this property 

owner's project but not that property owner's?  Why is this 

use okay and why is that use not okay?"   

          I think given the vagueness with which the 

language is written, this Board member at least has a lot of 

hesitation about having the Board be in that position.  It 

is not the -- you know, the language does not say, "This

only becomes operable after a bridge is built."  I mean, if 

it said that, I think you'd have a lot less resistance about 

that particular aspect of it, although there are other 

issues.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  We would be within the Board's 

purview in a special permit.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No, but see -- but 

that -- I understand it would be within the Board purview 

within a special permit.  That is fundamentally different 

than saying that the bridge physically exists.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  I understand.  There is a three-year 

history of attempting to do a bridge in this area.  We've 

been working on it for three years.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So we have been 

working on it for longer than that.  So I think you're -- 

part of the resistance is we have had a lot of projects come 

through that have wanted to contribute to -- have offered to 

create space for a bridge to land, have made substantial 

financial contributions to a bridge and -- you know, have 

done that under the existing special permit process, and 

every -- you know, and we don't have a bridge.   

          And so --

          JAY DOHERTY:  I believe that the Board required of 

any of those -- and we were one of those with the applicant 

-- who were talking about contributions of some land, or a 

bridge to land, or $250,000 of planning.  The burden is on 

the proponent to show you that we are going to accomplish 

this bridge. 

          Now, let me talk a little bit about the bridge.  

First of all, in the sphere of the mild length from Belmont 

to Alewife Brook Parkway, this is the narrowest point, and 

it is uniquely a point where we could join two public ways -

- Smith Place and Cambridge Park Drive -- when we can 

accomplish 98 percent of what we need to do within MBTA 

private way, and the MBTA has preliminarily agreed to that. 

          If you move three -- to 400 feet east, you will 

find the infrastructure of the MBTA is enormous.  There are 

warehouses, there are special tracks, there are problems in 

terms of the distance to be spanned, which is more like 400 

feet.   

          A bridge in that location is very, very difficult 

to do, and it would take relocation of the MBTA services 

there.  And even then, you would have a distance of 400 feet 

to span.  This bridge is doable.  We're prepared to convince

you in the special permit that it's getting done.  And we 

understand that if you are not convinced, then you say this 

isn't enough.  But --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think what you're 

encountering, sir, is the fact that we want to be convinced 

at this --  

          JAY DOHERTY:  I understand.  We cannot -- this 

bridge is in and of itself a challenging project.  And if I 

could write for you a spec for the bridge today and say, 

"That is the bridge, we will build it," I would.   

          The problem is, we need a variety of parties to 

continue the process of input we've had.  And they may 

change certain aspects of the bridge.  The MBTA has a role.  

You have a role; you've been meeting with the city.  VCR may 

have a role. 

          All of the elements in manufacturing a bridge in 

terms of property ownership, the ability to get it done, the 

control of the land needed to get it done, are in this 

location and can be done.   

          But the reason that I can't give you a spec now, 

which I would expect to be able to give you a special 

permit, is that we don't have the final inputs.

          We spent two or three hours on the phone six weeks 

ago with Sasaki and all of the Division Heads of the MBTA 

reviewing.  One of the things I asked that we do tonight, 

which we didn't do, was that we review those plans with you.  

Those plans have advanced, the bridge is advancing, and by 

the time of the special permit. 

          But the bridge will cost several hundred thousand 

dollars to design for your special permit.  There is no 

point in us spending that money if we don't have a zoning 

that facilitates what we're trying to do here.   

          We can do a 55-foot-height limit project under the 

existing zoning.  Yeah, we'll do five bucks a square foot or 

something like that that everybody else has done.  That's 

not what we're trying to do.   

          We're actually trying to get this thing done.  And 

the zoning treats the development of the bridge and the 

appropriateness of the uses as gating issues -- as gating 

issues. 

          And if there's no uncertainty about that -- that 

is the entire premise of the zoning, if it's not adequately 

reinforced in this draft, it can be.  Otherwise, all of the 

things that you'd normally have custody of beyond those 

134

issues you still have custody -- by the way, I would say 

that the reference here to an unregulated item, the garage, 

was in error.   

          What we are trying to do is clarify that if we 

build a 70-foot-tall residential building attached to a 

garage, the garage needs to be 75-feet-tall, that the height 

of the building in front doesn't shrink the height of the 

building in back.   

          We also would like to know how the Board will 

treat -- and you probably have more investigation through 

zoning -- both landscaping, and more importantly solar. 

          Those are the issues about height.  There's no 

other issues about height.  So that was kind of an error on 

our part. 

          But the reason for location -- I'm happy to do a 

comprehensive review of why this bridge works when others 

don't.  And I understand that the test at special permit 

time will be whether or not it's credible.  No, it's not 

what we did for the Atmark.  For the Atmark, we were asked 

to donate $250,000 for a plant to build a bridge.  That was 

in 2013.  We donated the $250,000.  I don't know that it's 

advanced the cause of making a bridge.

          As long as we've been dealing with this issue, we 

have to find a place at least to do the first one, and you 

have to find that place has to be able to be developed in 

terms of the MBTA right of way, and it needs to connect 

public ways in a reasonable way. 

          The things that otherwise have to follow here -- 

traffic impacts -- and that will be addressed under the --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Doherty.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  So you asked the question.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Board 

members, what is -- what are we feeling like we want to do 

with this proposal this evening?   

          I have heard a lot of concerns from Board members 

that while conceptually there is some support for the goals 

articulated for this zoning, that the language does not yet 

reflect the intent conveyed by the staff, or the 

presentation we have seen tonight.   

          I for one would feel better about seeing language 

that did reflect that.  But I would love to hear input from 

other Board members on feeling we can -- you know, continue 

the hearing, we can make a recommendation based on what's 

before us, or we can make a positive -- or we can comment

without making a recommendation and move this forward to the 

City Council. 

          What do Board members want to do this evening?  

Lou, you've got your hand up.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Continue.  Need more 

information and clean this language up.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Others?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I agree with Lou.  This is an 

opportunity that we can't say no to, and we can't say, 

"Well, we just are uncomfortable.  We've got to get it done, 

and Lou's suggestion is the way -- is the next step to get 

it done."      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  I'm 

hearing two in favor of continuing the hearing.  Corinne?            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I apologize, because we were 

probably told this, and I don't remember.  Is there already 

a scheduled time forth to go before City Council?  And if we 

continue it, does that pause their hearing, or does that 

mean it goes to City Council without our comments?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I do not currently --

and Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong -- they do not currently 

have an Ordinance Committee hearing scheduled for this?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's correct, they don't.  This 

would need to have a hearing scheduled sometime in the month 

of September; could be later in September.   

          And just to clarify the process, so the City 

Council can, you know, can wait -- if they have time, they 

can have their Ordinance Committee hearing, and then they 

can still wait to hear what the Planning Board says, or they 

could move forward without the Planning Board's 

recommendation.  It's sort of under the discretion of the 

Council. 

          The only thing that under the statute they have to 

do is give the Planning Board the opportunity to provide a 

recommendation before they take action.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Steve?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, I agree that it needs more 

work, and that it needs greater clarity.  And it's certain 

that ultimately, we are going to make a positive 

recommendation to the Council.  But I'm not sure exactly 

what it is that we need to do, and how we're going to do it

between now and then.   

          You know, we have a sense that it isn't clear 

enough in certain respects, but we're not perfectly clear 

what it is that has to be done that will get us to that 

point of clarity.   

          And, you know, maybe it would take some serious 

work from Staff between now and the next meeting to -- you 

know, work through it and make some specific recommendations 

that might get us to that point of clarity and comfort in 

moving it forward. 

          We want to move it forward.  Not quite sure what 

it's going to take to help us get there.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I do think, 

Steve, that it will take work from Staff and one of the 

things that Staff was looking for from us tonight is -- you 

know, frankly adequate interest in and support of the 

petition to warrant their further investment of time and 

effort.   

          And certainly I am hearing that we would like to 

see some development here to facilitate development of a 

bridge and of the Light Industrial uses, and I think that 

the Board has expressed adequate support to warrant that

kind of investment of time.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Absolutely.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I also would 

say that there are Board members here -- and I count myself 

among them -- who love wordsmithing documents and may have 

some suggestions that they can offer in the form of written 

comments to staff for the record, and I would encourage 

everyone who has ideas about how the language can better 

reflect the intent of what we're being told is trying to be 

accomplished here, forward those to staff so that they can 

do that work in a more expeditious fashion.   

          I don't think the public hearing is the place 

where we wordsmith a substantial text document, but it is 

the place where we identify are we generally in favor of 

staff spending the time to do that or not?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Madam Chair, this is Tom --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, Tom.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I hope everybody understands I'm 

not a wordsmither, but I'm a builder.  And I think I 

understood Mr. Doherty that no bridge no deal.  And it's 

about as clear as that.  And I think I remember saying that

some years ago when we first discussed this.   

          So that's what the language has to say, and no 

high-bay uses on that first shore, no deal.  So I think he's 

willing to accept terms that clear.  So that's how we have 

to do that in zoning language, rather than in -- I don't 

know, poker language.      

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Can I follow up on the bridge 

thingy?  Are we clear what we're talking about in a bridge?  

Is it a pedestrian bridge?  Is it a vehicular bridge?  What 

is it?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I don't think we 

have clarified the specs on it at this point.  I do think 

that that -- to the extent the Board can be clear about that 

in the zoning language, it would frankly make our job easier 

at the special permit phase.   

          But to -- you know, Mr. Doherty's point earlier, 

what they may be able to do may vary, depending on what they 

can get a special permit for. 

          So I think the first thing we need to do is get 

language that clarifies -- as Tom articulately put it, no 

bridge no deal -- and then if the Board feels that we need 

to be as clear as no vehicular bridge no deal, or, you know, 

141

no pedestrian bridge no deal, whatever we want at the zoning 

stage, we should do that. 

          Or if we are open to reviewing the development 

proposal and seeing if it is supportive of different scales 

of bridges, we can do that.  But if the Board feels 

strongly, it has to be one kind or another of a bridge, we 

should say so.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So I would direct people's 

attention to pages 16,17 and 18 of the December 17, 2019, 

which was the document that was given to us the last time we 

discussed it, which defines reasonably clearly the schematic 

design of the bridge, which is a bicycle and pedestrian 

bridge, you know, with the ramps and bicycles and elevators 

and stairs for pedestrians, and it's shown at a certain 

width.  And you know, it's -- to me you look at that and you 

say, "That's a useful bridge, yeah."  

          So it's there, you know?  The rest of that 

presentation covers a number of the points Steve brought up 

about the uses, the sizes of buildings, the heights.  All 

that stuff has been put forward as a concept that fits under 

the proposed zoning issue.  And I think, you know, that's 

very helpful.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, you've had your 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted, I think you're on mute.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm sorry, the Space bar isn't 

hand up.     

working.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  There you go.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I was going to say that -- Tom 

put it very succinctly that what I understood Mr. Doherty to 

say was no bridge, no special permit no extra GFA, and if 

the language says that then I could delay it.   

          And so, I would recommend that we do a 

continuance, and I know it'll put staff and CCF hard at work 

for a while, but I think that's what we need to see. 

          And just following up on what Hugh said, I've 

always understood that the city had taken a position that 

there was never going to be a vehicular bridge connecting 

the two sides, and that it was always going to be a 

pedestrian and bicycle bridge. 

          If somebody wants to challenge that, I'm open to 

hearing it, but I'd always understood it had been previously 

determined by Traffic and Parking and whomever else that 

this was never going to be.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I will say that 

during the Alewife study, it was definitely discussed 

primarily as a pedestrian and bicycle bridge.  There is -- 

and, you know, staff can correct me on this -- I would say 

there is some element of the public who would like to see 

this be vehicular, because they feel that the traffic 

impacts without it being -- of a pedestrian and vehicle 

bridge are not sufficient to offset the additional 

development.   

          I think I personally was convinced by the traffic 

analysis that a pedestrian and bike bridge would be 

sufficient, but not everyone is, and -- again -- I tend to 

support that.  I agree with you that's what we have 

generally been talking about all along. 

          But if that is not what the Board is going to be 

looking for, I do think we should say so.  Iram, did you 

want to weigh in on that?           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just 

wanted to note that from Staff perspective, there's 

definitely been focus on a bicycle and pedestrian bridge, 

and that's a connection that's very much needed.  Having a 

vehicular bridge could actually cause more harm than good in 

144

some ways, because it will still draw people from one place 

that is congested to another street that's congested and 

will not necessarily accomplish much. 

          However, there has been discussion -- and I know 

that several Councillors have spoken about the notion of 

having small shuttles like electric EMU type shuttles that 

would be very small and still be able to be accommodated on 

a bridge that's not much larger than a bike/ped bridge.  So 

it would be like a three-, four-person shuttle as opposed to 

a big -- you know, a bus itself. 

          So that is certainly something that has been under 

consideration.  It's not been designed or feasibility has 

not been done, and certainly not at this location.   

          And it would likely involve longer ramping, which 

could be challenging.  So I mean I think that while there is 

a desire, there is much more work to be done to resolve 

whether it's feasible or not.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, just a quick comment, 

and to Iram's point.  I remember Mr. Doherty actually 

talking about having a negotiation or at least a talk with 

an autonomous vehicle shuttle service.

          And I believe he was right at the time.  It's an 

awful long walk from where this bridge starts to where we -- 

his development will be.  Bad weather -- not a lot of people 

will be willing.  So it's a great thing to look at, and like 

everything else, it just needs to fit together, and it needs 

to be delivered.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  This zoning proposal covers a 

district that’s maybe three times the size of the property.  

If the only person who can take advantage of this proposal 

is Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, because they're the only ones who 

have the ability to build a bridge, shouldn't the proposal 

be shrunk through their property?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Maybe that's a 

question we can ask Staff to explore with the Zoning 

Department, or -- excuse me -- with the Legal Department, 

showing that this hearing has gone on entirely too long at 

this point for me to be able to be coherent over Zoom.  All 

right.   

          I think, Jeff, unless you have specific questions 

you've gotten a lot of feedback here from the Board tonight, 

including some support for the concept, but desire to see it

better reflected in the language.  Is there anybody else you 

need from us tonight before we continue the hearing?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No, I think -- not much.  I think 

I've got a lot to work with, and there may be a few gaps 

that need to be filled in, and that can happen when it comes 

back to the Planning Board.  I just wanted to be -- to try 

to be sort of clear on what the Planning Board's 

expectations are for us.   

          So the Board can continue this hearing, and you 

are making a request of staff that we provide our 

recommended changes to the language or recommended sort of 

version of the zoning language that is consistent with the 

intent that's been kind of reflected I think by most of the 

participants here at this meeting, both the petitioner's 

representatives at CC&F and at least several of the Planning 

Board members in terms of wanting to be clearer about what 

the expected requirements would be in return for the 

additional height and other zoning flexibility that's being 

sought. 

          I think that we can do that, and we'll certainly 

continue to communicate with the Cabot, Cabot & Forbes team, 

and I just wanted to be clear that this will be kind of

Staff's take on things.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And, you know, we -- and then it'll 

be up for discussion.  I guess the point is it's sort kind 

of flipping -- it's sort of flipping the -- it's kind of 

flipping the responsibilities a little bit where we'll be 

offering our suggestions and the petitioners and the Board 

members can comment on that. 

          It's a fun position to be in, because it wasn't 

initiated as our zoning petition, but I think that that's 

something that we can do.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That would be 

appreciated.   I know it's a lot of work for the staff to do 

that, especially with petitions you don't initiate, and I 

also appreciate that it doesn't make sense for you to do 

that, unless you do get a preliminary indication of support 

from the Board.   

          But I think you have that, and we would appreciate 

your staff's expertise in having this language better 

reflect the intent that's been expressed here tonight. 

          So is there a motion to continue the hearing?    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So moved.    

148

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Second is Ted.

moved, Ted seconded.  Roll call vote to continue the 

hearing?

                  Corinne Espinoza  

          We do have one last item on the agenda that was 

listed for tonight.  That item was for us the discuss Board 

of Zoning Appeals cases.   

          A Board member had requested that we discuss BZA 

017312-2020, a variance for signage at 201-203 Concord 

Turnpike.  However, we have been informed that the 

application has since been withdrawn.   

          There doesn't appear to be anything there to 

discuss, but particularly where we had advertised we wanted 

to discuss it tonight, I wanted to just check and see if any 

Board members have any questions or comments before we 

adjourn for the evening?    

          [Pause]  

          Going once?  Okay, hearing none, then that 

concludes the business on our agenda.  Any additional 

150

comments or questions for Staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Any Board 

members have anything to add before we adjourn?  Nope?  Then 

the meeting is adjourned.  Thank you all.
