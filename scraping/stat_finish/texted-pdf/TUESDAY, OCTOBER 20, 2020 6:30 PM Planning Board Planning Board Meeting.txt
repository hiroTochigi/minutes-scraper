          MARY FLYNN:  Good evening.  Welcome to the October 

20, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My name 

is Mary Flynn, and I am the Vice Chair acting as Chair for 

this meeting.  

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

September 2, 2020.  

                    This meeting is being video and audio 

recorded, and is being streamed live on the City of 

Cambridge online meeting portal and on cable television

Channel 22, within Cambridge.  There will also be a 

transcript of the proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

          I will start by asking Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible. Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  This is Jeff 

Roberts from Community Development Department.  Just for 

quick attendance of Planning Board members and to confirm 

that the meeting is audible.   

          Louis Bacci, are you present and is the meeting 

audible to you?   

audible.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Present and the meeting is 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  H Theodore Cohen, 

are you present and is the meeting audible to you?

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Present, and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Steve.  Hugh Russell, 

are you present, is the meeting audible to you?   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Present, and the meeting is 

audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Hugh.  Nikolas Bowie, 

are you present and is the meeting audible to you?           

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Present, and the meeting is 

audible to me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Niko.  It was indicated 

that Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza, and Catherine Preston 

Connolly would not be present at the meeting.  If any of 

those members are present, please say so now.     

          [Pause]    

          Those members are marked as absent, and Mary 

Flynn, you're obviously present; can you just confirm that 

the rest of the meeting is audible to you?         

          MARY FLYNN:  It is audible.  Okay, thank you Mary.  

That is six members present.

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you Jeff.  Moving on, 

then, the first item is an Update from Community Development 

Department.  Please also introduce the staff present at the 

meeting -- and I believe Jeff, will you be doing this?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, I'll handle that as well.   

          Again, Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning and 

Development.  With me in the Zoning Development team are 

Swaathi Joseph, who is running the slide presentation for 

this meeting; also Liza Paden and Daniel Messplay are 

present from Zoning and Development.   

          We also have Erik Thorkildsen from Community 

Development in Urban Design.  We have Iram Farooq, the 

Assistant City Manager for Community Development; and Khalil 

Mogassabi, the Deputy Director of the Community Development 

Department and Chief of Planning. 

          And from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department, we have Joseph Barr, the Director of that 

Department; and Adam Shulman, the Transportation Planner 

within that Department. So that does it for staff that are 

present.  

          And just switching over to updates, looking ahead 

to the future business of the Board, we've got a couple of

things to go through tonight, so I'll try to go quickly 

through this update.  Next week, October 27, there will be a 

preapplication conference on a PUD development that MIT will 

be proposing on the Volpe site parcel.   

          This is a parcel that I think everyone is familiar 

with.  This is an informal discussion to talk about their 

initial plans and to get feedback and have some dialogue 

with the Planning Board before they make their formal PUD 

development proposal application.   

          We'll also have an extension request that we 

received for a special permit that was granted at 605 

Concord Avenue. 

          November 3, as I've noted, that is Election Day, 

there is no meeting that day.  Everybody please vote.  

November 10, we do have a meeting, and we have a public 

hearing scheduled on the Canal District Kendal PUD; that's a 

zoning petition by BioMed Realty.   

          The Planning Board has heard this once before, and 

made some comments, so this hearing will be largely a follow 

up from that previous discussion.  That zoning petition will 

also have a hearing at the Ordinance Committee on November 

12.

          Then, back at the Planning Board on November 17, 

there will be a public hearing on a zoning petition to amend 

the MXD District.  This is a zoning petition that's intended 

to facilitate the relocation of a site that's owned 

currently by Eversource, where there is the expectation of 

building an electrical transformer substation.   

          So that's a proposal with a lot of moving parts -- 

we'll be talking about that at the Planning Board November 

17, and then the Ordinance Committee will have its hearing 

on November 19.   

          Those are the only hearings that we have scheduled 

at this point.  We are still nailing some dates now, so I 

should have some more to update the Board on maybe by next 

week.   

          We do have a number of zoning petitions coming the 

way of the Planning Board, including one having to do with 

cannabis delivery.   

          We also have a zoning petition that -- a referral 

of the zoning petition on the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest 

Overlay District, which the Planning Board has discussed a 

couple of times -- that's been referred again by the City 

Council and will be coming forward, and some zoning 

9

petitions based on some recommendations from staff and the 

City Council Economic Development Committee on retail land 

uses and home occupations.  That was just referred last 

night; we'll be finding a date for that. 

          We also have several items of both continued and 

new special permit business that we'll be putting on the 

calendar, and I won't go through all of it right now.  So 

I'll just turn it back over to Mary, thanks.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  Are there any 

questions from Planning Board members?  If so, would you 

please state your name?     

          [Pause]  

          Okay.  Hearing none, let us move on, then, to the 

next item, which is Approval of Meeting Minutes.  The Board 

has received certified transcripts for the meetings held on 

September 15 and September 22, 2020.  If there are any 

questions from Board members, please say your name and ask 

your question.     

          [Pause]  

          None.  Okay.  Is there a motion, then, to accept 

the transcripts as the meeting minutes?  And remember to 

please say your name as you make the motion.

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, Ted moved first.  Lou, do you 

want to second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Okay.  Jeff, could we 

have a roll call vote, please?

minutes, Louis Bacci?

(6:34 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  Mary T. Flynn, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven   

                  A. Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, 

                 and Nikolas Bowie 

          MARY FLYNN:  The next item on the agenda is a 

public hearing on case PB #367, a special permit application 

by ARE Mass Region #61, LLC to construct a 370,462 gross 

square foot technical office building at 325 Binney Street, 

pursuant to Section #19.20 Project Review Special permit and 

Section 20.1000 Grand Junction Overlay District.   

          CDD Staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us, and so, once again I'll turn it over to Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary. Just -- Jeff 

Roberts, Director of Zoning Development one more time.   

          Earlier this year the City Council adopted the 

Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District, which enabled the 

development proposal that is before the Board tonight.   

          That zoning change, or the new zoning district, 

allows increased density and height for development in this 

particular area, in exchange for the dedication of land and 

12

funding to the city for a section of the Grand Junction 

Multi-use Path.  

          There are some special permit findings that the 

Board has to make to find that the development proposal 

meets the particular objectives of the Grand Junction 

Pathway Overlay District. 

          But otherwise this falls into the realm of a 

Project Review special permit, which requires review and 

findings regarding transportation impacts, and regarding 

Urban Design.  So I'll turn it over there.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  Our presenter this 

evening is James Rafferty on behalf of the applicant.  

Before we begin, I'll note that we have six Planning Board 

members present, and an affirmative vote of five members is 

necessary to grant a special permit.  So Mr. Rafferty, are 

you and your team prepared to proceed with that number of 

Board members?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yes, Madam Chair.  It was my 

understanding we have five Board member present.  Do we have 

six?       

          MARY FLYNN:  We have six, we have six.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Oh, perfect.

          MARY FLYNN:  It's more than what you need, but I 

just want to confirm.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yes, no, I appreciate the 

inquiry.  We were made aware of that fact.  So yeah, the 

applicant is prepared to go forward with less than the full 

complement of Board members.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Thank you very much.  

Well, in that case you have up to 30 minutes for your 

presentation, though the Board can allow additional time at 

our discretion.  If you would please introduce your Project 

Team and begin your presentation?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you, again.  Good evening 

Madam Chair.  For the record, my name is James Rafferty.  

I'm an attorney with offices located at 907 Massachusetts 

Avenue.  I'm appearing this evening on behalf of Alexander 

Real Estate Equities. 

          Present this evening is Michele Lauer, who will 

introduce the rest of the Project Team in just a moment. 

          I just wanted to review a couple of highlights for 

the Board as we begin the presentation.  We've put 

considerable effort into organizing this presentation in a 

logical and concise fashion.

          It begins, I would suggest, with the memo provided 

by Community Development, which does an effective job in 

recounting the history of the zoning that got us to this 

point.   

          Board members may recall this as it involved the 

farming of the zoning petition not once, but three times 

before it was ultimately adopted. 

          So this evening's presentation, many of the images 

and topics covered will not be new to Board members, given 

your participation in the zoning amendment process on this.  

          What I do want to bring to the Board's attention 

at the outset, however -- is the obligation assigned with 

this project that are set forth in the Letter of Commitment.   

          The Letter of Commitment, as we know, is often an 

issue of some discussion among Board members in terms of its 

relevance vis-à-vis the actual text of the ordinance. 

          This Letter of Commitment is referenced in our 

ordinance, and it contains three key components that 

Alexandria has committed to for the Cambridge City Council. 

          The first is Alexandria has agreed to convey the 

land necessary to extend the Grand Junction Pathway from 

Binney Street to Cambridge Street, and Michelle Lauer will

show you the layout of that land and Alexandria's efforts to 

acquire it. 

          At any rate, the Letter of Commitment says within 

90 days of the issuance of this special permit, there will 

be a conveyance of that land to the city. 

          The second item in the Letter of Commitment is a 

commitment for the design and construction of the Grand 

Junction Pathway, $11.2- -- there's $250,000 -- $11.25 

million dollars for the design and construction of the Grand 

Junction Pathway, paid for by Alexandria. 

          And the third item of commitment is a commitment 

to purchase land currently owned by Eversource on Fulkerson 

Street, that has been the source of much focus since 

Eversource acquired it and revealed plans to locate a 

transformer at that location. 

          Alexandria, you may recall, was involved in a 

significant amount of negotiation with Eversource and Boston 

Properties about a transaction that would facilitate the 

relocation of that substation to a location in the MXD 

District.   

          And as the Board knows, you'll be hearing a zoning 

petition on that in the not too distant future.

Alexandra played a key role in two aspects of that 

relocation effort.   

          One is a commitment to purchase the land on 

Fulkerson Street from Eversource at a price of $12.9 million 

dollars, which is what Eversource paid for the land.   

          But it's a land price much higher than market 

value would suggest, best evidenced by the fact that 

Eversource purchased the land on the same day that their 

seller acquired it, for half that amount of money.   

          So Alexandria will make Eversource whole with the 

purchase or repurchase of that land, and following the 

purchase of the land, Alexandria will then convey that land 

to the city for public purposes determined by the city in a 

public project. 

          The other portion of Alexandria's participation in 

the Eversource relocation is an agreement they have made 

with Boston Properties to accommodate up to 300 motor 

vehicles from the Blue Garage in the MXD District, into the 

OKS -- the 1 Kendall Square Garage.  That was a critical 

component because there are commitments associated with that 

parking that Boston Properties had to be able to satisfy. 

          Having said all that, there's just one slide I was

going to ask to be seen, just to orient the Board slightly.  

So maybe we could see the next slide?  Thank you.   

          This is the site -- I know everyone is familiar 

with it -- just a couple of things to point out.   

          You'll see with the different shading that the 

front portion of the site in the Industrial District is 

where the proposed building will be located.  There will be 

no structure in the Residential C1 portion of the district, 

which is to the right.   

          It's also worth remembering that the land that I 

just described -- the so-called Eversource land -- is shaded 

here in the hatched area.  That apparently is owned by 

Eversource, and its uncertain future has -- you'll see in 

our presentation, does have some impact on how we planned 

the publicly beneficial open space in the area in the 

Residence C1 District.                                       

          Michelle Lauer will now take the Board through all 

aspects of the Grand Junction Pathway, as well as introduce 

the design.  Thank you very much.     

          MICHELLE LAUER:  Thanks, Jim.  Michelle Lauer with 

Alexandria Real Estate.  Good evening, everyone.   

          Swaathi, to the next slide, please?   

18

          Just a quick reminder.  As Jim mentioned, everyone 

should be very familiar with the zoning.  You can see the 

massing here that was passed in our rezoning back in March 

of 2020.  The design you'll see tonight does correspond to 

this massing. 

          Next slide? 

          And just a reminder to those folks -- I'm sure 

everyone who knows the area knows what the site looks like 

today; it is primarily asphalt, there are very little porous 

surfaces on it.  So we will be adding a significant amount 

of porous and grassed area to the site. 

          Next slide, please?   

          As a reminder, Jim said we've been working on this 

process through three refilings of the zoning, and now 

through the building design for more than 16 months, and 

more than 40 public meetings.   

          We've had some wonderful celebration with many 

constituent groups, multiple neighbors -- especially the 

Linden Park Residents Association -- a special thanks goes 

out to them, the Ordinance Committee chairs, as well as City 

Staff and certainly our Design Team.

          As Jim mentioned, a summary of the public benefits 

that we have that go along with our zoning.  More than 1800 

linear feet, or a third of a mile, as we'll talk about with 

the Grand Junction Path; $11.25 million dollars for design 

and construction of that pathway, and the $13 million 

dollars to purchase the Eversource site.   

          Next slide, please?   

          Next slide, please?  moving on to the details of 

the Grand Junction Multi-use Path that we can see here, the 

more than a third of a million section that we will be 

conveying to the city is really a vital link that in the 

future will be -- that will link the Grand Junction Path 

from the future West Station in Allston to the Somerville 

Community Path in Somerville, and eventually out to the 

Minuteman Bike Path out in Bedford.   

          Next slide, please? 

          You can see here the section in the foreground is 

Cambridge Street that stretches to Binney Street in the top 

of the page.  And this is the -- this was an 1800 linear 

foot more than a third of a mile.  It was multiple land 

compilations that we needed to acquire.   

          We'll move onto the next slide.

          My favorite little building here, 686 Cambridge 

Street.  You can see the Loyal 9 Café over in the left-hand 

side.  This building is currently in the process of being 

demolished.  It is being remediated, and will be demolished 

in the coming weeks.  So we are moving forward with the 

acquisition and preparation of that land for the Grand 

Junction Path.   

          Next slide, please?  And so, in the future this is 

a concept rendering that we've put together.  We will not be 

designing or constructing the path, but this is -- we will 

be giving the $11.25 million dollars to the city to go 

through the process to design that and construct the 

pathway.   

          But this really is a gateway for Cambridge Street 

into the Multi-use Path, into Kendall Square.  And really 

similar -- we've always thought of it as similar to Linear 

Park up in North Cambridge and the Minuteman bike path.   

          So we think it really could be quite a grand 

entrance to get people off the city streets and into a 

Multi-use Pathway direct straight line to Kendall Square 

from Cambridge Street. 

          So with that, I will -- we can go to the next

slide, Swaathi. 

          I will pass it off to the building designer, Jay 

Siebenmorgen from NBBJ and his team, and then who will be 

followed by Jacob Knowles from BR+A and Selma Mandzo to 

discuss transfer from VHB.  So with that, Jay, take it away.  

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Hello?  Thanks, Michelle.  Jay 

Siebenmorgen, Architect with NBBJ.  Just to start here, 

first I want to orient everybody with what you'll see on 

each view -- there's a key plan on the bottom left that will 

have a red arrow that gives you the orientation where you're 

standing for each particular view.   

          So this is a building that encompasses many layers 

of programmatic meaning.  First, it is a building that acts 

as a fulcrum point in scale, pivoting the city group from 

east to west in negotiating scale from south to north 

towards the Linden Park Neighborhood. 

          Second, this is a building that is being designed 

with notable sustainable design goals that we will hear more 

about later.  And there's a building being designed for 

Human Wellness and Comfort.   

          This means great access to natural light; it means 

flexibility for how one moves throughout the building, and 

22

it is a building that is designed to foster collaboration. 

          This first view looking north from the inner 

section of Broadway and Galileo Way speaks to the central 

energy of the south façade massing, where we have located an 

internal atrium space that integrates one- and two-story 

high meeting spaces on the south side of the atrium.   

          The program elements we affectionally refer to as, 

"the jewels" are a direct reflection of the dynamic program 

occurring inside.  And this view also speaks to the 

importance of this kind of axial view within the city and 

within Kendall Square. 

          Next slide? 

          The building negotiates this shift in the grid by 

bending and aligning with the little Binney Street grid to 

the west, and the main Binney Street grid to the east.   

          We use this maneuver to open up the building 

essentially on the south edge of the atrium at this fulcrum 

point that is a 24-degree turn, which actually allows us to 

design these spaces in a way that offers great views and 

light to each collaboration in jewel space as you move up 

the building.   

          And so, they're not only limited to a south view,

but they have access to views and lights to the east and the 

west. 

          The façades of these are actually coplanar with 

the respective façades.  So if you take your hand and you 

bend it, that's essentially how it works -- that they are 

trajectories of each façade.   

          Next slide?   

          The building is also pulled back from the street 

25 feet.  This allows more breathing room for the bicycle 

lane, more space for vehicular drop-off, and provides a 

great corner plaza space that increases pedestrian safety 

and opens up the corner to get views from vehicles coming to 

this busy intersection. 

          You can see we also use it as an opportunity to 

lift up the scale of the building at this corner that frames 

the plaza space, as well as makes a clear identification 

marker for the main entrance to the building.   

          Of note, you will see a few things occurring in 

the façade design.  First, we're designing towards a 

standard 11-foot lab planning module, so we wanted to 

develop a module that could be refined and elegant, with 

subtle details that will interact with light and shadow in

different ways throughout the day. 

          Second, with this being the south façade, we are 

designing a shading system that will block direct heat gain 

with the summer sun, while reflecting a warm, ambient light 

into the collaboration spaces of the jewels. 

          And the jewel box is finally comfortably housed 

above the canopies that undulate between Level 1 and Level 

2.  So they're never out over the street, where there is 

sidewalk.   

          Next slide?   

          So as you pull back here on Binney Street, you 

will notice we're really dealing with very specifically with 

two material color ranges, because we wanted to create a 

building that is warm and inviting in appearance, but can 

still speak to the innovation occurring here, and within 

Kendall Square. 

          We used this starting for the main expression of 

the atrium spaces, but also, if you shift to the next slide 

you will see an entrance at the middle of the massing at the 

Fulkerson entrance.  The contrast entrance points to the 

building. 

          So also, we shift the materials, right?  So when

you get to the central area of the scale, this is the shift 

in massing from the south massing to the north massing, and 

they also were designing this as a kind of another social 

zone within the building where the façade shifts back and 

creates accessible balconies for the tenants.  

          Next slide? 

          So here as you look south -- this is the north 

elevation -- you can actually see that metal zone where the 

Fulkerson entrance is.  So we continue this interplay 

between the lighter and warmer material, and we do it again 

as we move around the building. 

          What you're seeing to the right there is above the 

loading dock, to create a nice, warm expression towards the 

Linden Park Neighborhood.    

          Next slide?  This next image is actually a view 

from the closest residence building, Linden Park Community.  

And what you will see coming up is our strategy for how the 

dense plankings are going to occur along the -- on the 

property along the bike path to shield the views to a 

loading dock as well as the scale of the bleeding.    

          Next slide? 

          This is you can see just off of the bike path

looking south.   

          And what is occurring here is actually these are 

just first ideas here where we see potential opportunity for 

art, where this is the support spaces for the building.  So 

there are several access points to the back of house. 

          So we really are interested in how we can design 

all the beautiful kind of screenwork placeholder for art 

piece that will shield these access points to the building.    

          Next slide? 

          And of note too -- so again, we -- in regards to 

the mechanical penthouses, the one on the north massing is 

20-foot tall, the one on the south is 25-foot tall.  So the 

design also actually steps down the massing on the south, so 

that we further break down the scale of the building.    

          Next slide? 

          And then finally, this is a view from the Binney 

Park, looking at really how we're actually very intentional 

about proportional relationships within the building.  So 

these kinds of two-story shifts that start with the two-

story expression at the plaza space, we shift to the two-

story collaboration spaces that shift up along the center of 

the building.

          So now we will shift into some -- oh actually, 

sorry.  Next slide is actually the materials.  We have three 

materials that we are working with on the project.  The 

lighter material is a tactile, sort of high-performance 

concrete, and that's the dominant material on the façade 

that you can see labeled on here.   

          And then we are working with what's called, 

"Pure+FreeForm" metal panel.  The actual panel, so this 

creates a kind of -- the warmth of the wood color, if you 

refer to it as that -- we're actually working with evolving 

the pattern that you see here to be something a bit more 

abstract.   

          We've been working with Tactile.  What you see 

here is actually a custom aggregate; it's recycled glass 

that is the aggregate that you see here.   

          And then on the Fulkerson façades, which is on the 

next slide it -- again -- is a Tactile panel, and this is an 

actual photograph of a larger sample.   

          What you see in the bottom center here is a metal 

panel sample that you saw on the previous slide, and how 

we've been working with Tactile to create a custom pattern 

that will actually create a kind of different kind of

effect, so that we can have this really durable material 

that reads of this very warm kind of quality at the 

Fulkerson entrance, but then also these support façades that 

are along the north and the west, towards the bike path.    

          Next slide? 

please?   

          So as we go into the landscape -- next slide, 

          So the site design here, that shows a comparison 

actually of that corner plaza space at Binney Street and 

Fulkerson, compared to the Fulkerson entrance.   

          So the Binney Street plaza is actually intended to 

be more active.  It provides a very safe kind of space for 

the public to pass through and sit, whereas the Fulkerson 

entrance is something that's intended to be more quiet and 

serene and a secondary entrance to the building. 

          As we continue around, north is plan right.  

You'll see dashed circles in the plan in the Parcel C-1 

area, those are actually the geothermal wells, which we'll 

here more about from Jacob coming up.  But those are 

dispersed through that C-1 parcel in which the landscape is 

actually can be thought of more as a low-maintenance meadow 

throughout there. 

29

          Then you can see the location of the loading dock 

as we continue to move around the building.  You can see the 

access path for the support programs to the building.  And 

then on the upper left corner you can see where the 23 

Bluebikes stations are located, as well as a two-lane garage 

access drive.    

          Next slide? 

          And the materials that we're thinking about for 

both plaza spaces are intended to use common materials 

between the two, but perhaps shift between the planting 

types and so forth.  But we do intend to have warm materials 

that actually tie into the façade design of different scales 

and shapes. 

          Next slide? 

          And this is a slide that speaks to a variation in 

species and color that is intended to be worked throughout 

the site.  So that will also work with the different levels 

of privacy and screening as well, and actually add to the 

kind of natural habitat that we're thinking of in this 

meadow space.   

          If you go to the next slide?   

          Then you see here -- and so, this is a -- you see

also the view of the loading dock and what is a 14-foot tall 

acoustic wall that is being designed around the loading dock 

to actually have an organic form that relates to a walking 

path that is within the C1 parcel.   

          And what's slightly visible here, you can see 

there's actually a security fence barrier that just to the 

north of the kind of circular, organic forms in the walking 

path for security. 

          See, the intention is that whole north zone is 

actually really like a wildlife preserve in a way. 

          Next slide?  So this is a view -- so the Earth 

actually will burn up to the back side of that acoustic 

wall.  So while it's 14-foot tall, it will not look that 

tall from this walk-in space.  It -- actually, there would 

be nice, green earth where it goes up to the back side of 

it.    

          Next slide? 

          And then here you see the plantings are actually -

- the trees are actually planted in rows of 3.  It's 

actually the diagonal.  So that actually further increases 

the density of the screen of how one will be able to see the 

building as they go by, as well as what's behind these trees

is the loading dock and the acoustic wall, so virtually you 

31

will not be able to see it. 

          Next slide? 

          And then here we're going to shift to the camera, 

see how this works.  Got the mobile camera here.  Can you -- 

are you all viewing my camera?  Just want to confirm that.  

Okay.  Are we good? 

          So I'm going to start with first this model, which 

is a sixteenth-scale model.  That's the model that you just 

saw a photograph of.  And what you may be able to see here 

is a slight variation in how the light hits the façade.  

That's actually a shallow pivot effect that we're doing with 

the panels as well.   

          So we'll have a nice kind of interplay of light 

during the day, as the sun moves throughout the building.  

The other thing of note is we're still thinking through the 

opacity of the skylight.   

          We know that obviously we want to design this in a 

way so there isn't -- you know, just crazy heat coming in 

there, so we're actually working with our lighting designers 

and so forth to determine the type of density and openness 

that we want to have within the skylight here.

21

22

          And this actually also shows you the kind of depth 

of each one of these meeting spaces.  So there is a two-

story, and then you can see one story in there as well, so 

there's a depth of about 30-35 feet before the atrium space 

that's inside. 

          And now, I'll move over to the massing model.  

This shows you also what -- I think what we're pretty 

excited about is actually several kinds of relationships 

that are occurring within the Binney Park area -- and 

actually different type of scales.   

          While this is a different kind of building than 

what's going on around it, it actually has certain 

geometries and setbacks that are actually quite similar to 

what's going on with for instance 301 Binney, or even in the 

Genzyme Building, even in the way we relate the height of 

this wall to this wall, as well as the setbacks of the 

mechanical spaces to how mechanical a step back from the 

buildings adjacent to it. 

          So this further ties into how we view this as this 

kind of fulcrum point between the relationship towards One 

Kendall Square and then back towards Binney Street as well. 

          And then as I move around, you can see how the 

33

height shifts from the north to the south.  So again, this 

is a six-story building that goes down to the four-story 

building, and then that's that Fulkerson entrance space in 

between that pivots and shifts back to create those outdoor 

kind of balcony spaces.   

          I'm getting in the way of my light.   

          And then as we look from the north going back, you 

can see there are other kind of strategies we've 

incorporated where we also shift the wall above the loading 

dock to further kind of break down the scale of the massing.  

          Also part of what you're seeing -- maybe you've 

seen in the design -- is actually a consistent kind of brow 

is what I'll call it, because it's not totally a canopy.  

But it actually wraps around the entire building that will 

shield from any kind of snow or ice melt on the building. 

          And -- let me just walk around the other side 

quick -- and so, this is the west façade, actually looking 

from the Linden Park Community.  Something else that we've 

done here is actually within the geometry.  When it comes 

across, we actually shift it back.  So it puts a relief in 

this middle zone that is also intended to have circulating 

stairs.

          So you have these kinds of key points in the 

building, as I talked about maximized flexibility.  And the 

design intent is that occupants are given many choices to 

move through the building, so they don't actually have to 

use elevators all the time. 

          So I think with that, I will shift it back to 

Jacob in the presentation.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  Thanks, Jay.  Can everybody hear 

me?  Great.   

          We can go to the next slide.   

          So we're all part of this community contributing 

to solve some of the biggest challenges that are facing our 

society today.  And Cambridge is really leading the way 

nationally on these big issues.   

          The three big ones that I want to talk about 

tonight for sustainability are greenhouse gas emissions, 

resilience and creating a really vibrant civic environment. 

          And so, for greenhouse gas emissions, we know that 

the City of Cambridge has set a goal of carbon neutral for 

new buildings, with successive waves of buildings meeting 

that requirement over time and ultimately with labs meeting 

that by 2030.

22

          In terms of resilience, we know the city has set 

requirements in terms of meeting preparedness for sea-level 

rise, and also, future weather events to minimize 

disruption.   

          And the city goals for creating a vibrant, healthy 

environment for the community are really paramount to this.  

So we wanted to make sure that we embodied those 

sustainability measures in the building itself.   

          From a carbon emissions standpoint, our goal -- 

and we've made huge strides towards a carbon-neutral 

solution for this building -- so we've greatly, dramatically 

reduced the fossil-fuel consumption of the building; really 

way out ahead as far as lab buildings go. 

          And we've also addressed the embodied carbon of 

the structure of the building, as well as the water 

footprint. 

          In terms of resilience, we're in alignment with 

the city's goals in being above the required flood 

elevation, as well as managing stormwater effectively.  We 

have standby power, obviously, for critical loads, and we 

are designed to handle future heat waves.   

          And then, as you know, there's a major focus here

in terms of contributing to the community in terms of the 

bike path and open space.   

          But we're also thinking about the future occupants 

of this building and their health and well-being looking at 

compliance with Fitwel certification as well as the 

preconditions to achieve WELL certification if the tenants 

decide to do so.   

          We can go to the next slide.   

          So a little more detail, what do we mean by, 

"being out ahead" in terms of reducing our carbon footprint 

for this building?  So specifically, our goal is to be the 

lowest fossil fuel commercial lab building in the city of 

Cambridge.  And we used the benchmarking data from the 

public energy reporting data and looked at all of the 

commercial lab buildings over 150,000 square feet.   

          And you can see them represented here in this 

chart.  And that is measured in terms of energy use 

intensity.  So how much energy do they use on a per square 

foot basis each year? 

          And we've identified both the total energy, which 

is the top of each bar for each of these individual 

buildings, as well as in red the fossil fuel consumption.

          And you can see where we are targeting currently 

in our energy model for this building at 25 Binney is all 

the way on the far right.  And so, it's not only targeting 

an EUI that’s lower than the others, but also the fossil 

fuel consumption is significantly diminished.   

          Ultimately, that energy consumption is intended to 

be offset by renewable energy, so that we do ultimately 

achieve a carbon-neutral operation. The way we're looking at 

that in terms of defining that Net Zero goal is to use the 

LEED Zero certification for the building.   

          And the next slide? So some of the strategies that 

we're using to achieve these goals, the first step in any 

ultra-low carbon building is to design a very efficient 

envelope, mechanical system, so that you reduce the loads 

down from a typical code-minimum building.   

          So we're cutting the loads on the envelope by 

using triple glazing and opaque walls so it's not all 

curtain wall, like many existing buildings.  And also, the -

- for example the heat recovery on the exhaust from the lab 

buildings is really the premium product on the market to 

minimize that heating demand. 

          And then once we get those loads drawn way down, 

38

16

22

there still is some heating demand, obviously.  And so, 

we're installing a geothermal borefield as our primary 

heating and cooling space.  That's kind of our base load 

that runs year-round for all of our heating and cooling 

loads. And that's been supplemented by our boilers and 

chillers for the higher peak load conditions.  

          So that geothermal system is greatly even further 

reducing the fossil fuel consumption.  And as I mentioned 

earlier, ultimately the goal is to then use renewable energy 

to offset the consumption that's used at the building.   

          Now, certainly we can't fit enough renewable 

energy onsite on the roof itself, so that mostly will be 

coming from offsite sources. 

          And then just in keeping -- on the next slide -- 

in keeping with the intent of being a good neighbor and 

meeting the goals of the city of Cambridge, we know that 

acoustics is a big concern.  And so, we've addressed 

acoustics through many measures -- sound attenuation and 

screening.   

          One thing that's particularly unique about this 

design is that all of the mechanical equipment except for 

the very tips of the exhaust stacks is all contained within

an enclosed penthouse.  Actually -- except for the cooling 

towers, obviously, have to be on the roof.  But that is also 

screened.   

          So really, everything is about as enclosed as you 

can reasonably get it to minimize any sound or visual impact 

to the neighbors.                   

          SELMA MANDZO:  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Selma 

Mandzo from VHB.  We are the Transportation Engineers on the 

project.  We completed the Article 19 required traffic 

impact study, which was certified by TP&T on July 31, and 

the next few slides provide a high-level summary of our 

findings and proposed mitigation. 

          So the slide we're looking at, to support the 

development of the traffic study, we worked with TP&T to 

define an appropriate study area.  The project side is 

highlighted in yellow in both maps.   

          The map on the right shows the existing transit 

network that we looked at, and the map on the left shows 

intersections we studied, identified with the red and blue 

dots. 

          And while it's not shown on the map in great 

detail, the track and loading access is proposed on 

40

Fulkerson Street to line up with the city's truck crowds and 

to not impact any truck-restricted roadways. 

          Garage access is proposed off Little Binney, as 

you can see from the previous discussions, and we did 

coordinate with TPAT on the best location for both of these 

access points. 

          Next slide?   

          As you know, the TIA's glasses required evaluation 

of Planning Board criteria for each project.  Out of the six 

major categories and 249 data points, the project was found 

to have 16 exceedances, with a lot of them related to 

current pedestrian infrastructure.  It is important to note 

that category A vehicle -- trip generation -- and category C 

-- traffic on residential streets -- did not get an 

exceedance.   

          Next slide? 

          In addition to the contributions that Michelle and 

Jim have talked about, I would like to call your attention 

to a few more items on this list, item 3 being the design of 

Little Binney Street with areas setting back the building by 

over 20 feet to allow for installation of sidewalks, 

sidewalk tracks with appropriate buffers, and a passenger

drop-off zone. 

          And then under item 4 on the list, the project has 

approved PTDM plan, with an SOV, or single-occupancy 

vehicle- goal of 35 percent and a 100 percent transit 

subsidy commitment.  ARE also agreed to install the larger 

23-dockable bike station on site.   

          Item 5, commitment to reduce parking ratio to 0.75 

spaces per thousand square feet.   

          And item 6, contribution of $250,000 towards a 

Kendall Square shuttlebus study.  And with that, I'll turn 

it back to Michelle.     

          MICHELLE LAUER:  Thanks, Selma.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Oh, I'm 

sorry.     

          MICHELLE LAUER:  No, go ahead.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  We were going to simply conclude 

by pointing out to the Board hopefully that some of the most 

recent correspondences arrived in the last 24 or 48 hours.  

Chief among them are letters of support from the East 

Cambridge Planning Team and the Linden Park Neighborhood.   

          I would suggest that not just support letters for 

the project, but they really are expressions of appreciation

for the community engagement that Alexandria has 

participated in in this project.   

          It really is a model that others could look to, 

and that level of support -- particularly with Linden Park, 

where we he had a working group through the zoning process 

and continue to have collaborative meetings on design -- 

really puts us in the position today that we feel extremely 

good about the outcome, the way the building design and 

program has been benefitted from early listening and early 

responsiveness. 

          So, having said that, I believe we've probably 

used all our time.  We did want to take the time to include 

our energy report, because it is true that this building 

will probably be the most energy efficient commercial lab 

building of the city, and it's being heralded as an example 

for others to follow.   

          So thank you for allowing us the opportunity to go 

into a little bit of depth as to how it is Jacob and his 

team have been able to achieve this level of sustainability.  

Thank you.     

          MICHELLE LAUER:  And one more just in conclusion.  

Wanted to note thank you to everybody in particular.  This

project is pretty exciting as well, because it has been 

designed fully virtually.   

          So we received our rezoning on March 2.  Our 

kickoff meeting for the design was on Zoom, and every 

meeting since then has been.  So thank you to City Staff, 

thank you to our residents, all of the community meetings 

we've had.  It's been a learning process, but I think it's 

gone really well.  So thank you to everybody.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, thanks to all of you for your 

really excellent and detailed presentation.  That is pretty 

incredible to think that you were able to do it all on Zoom.  

It shows you how far everybody's come in the last six months 

-- the only way of communicating. 

          So let us move now to public comment.  This is a 

public hearing.  So we're going to open it up, and any 

members of the public who wish to speak should now click the 

button at the bottom of the screen that says, "Raise hand."  

If you are calling by phone, you can raise your hand by 

pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had received 

written comments on this case from the Cambridge Bicycle 

Committee, a letter cosigned by Rachel Burkhardt and Carl

of the Friends of the Community Path, Pamela Van Dort, Jim 

Gray and Jason Stockmann of the Linden Park Neighborhood 

Association, Joseph Rose, and C.A. Webb of the Kendall 

Square Association. 

          Written communications received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will be entered into the record. 

          So now we have a paper with comments, and yes, I 

see that.  So I'm going to turn it over to Jeff to manage 

the public comment portion of this.  And we're going to 

begin by -- we'll unmute the speakers one at a time.    

          Everyone should begin by saying your name and 

address, and staff will confirm that we can hear you.  After 

that, you will have up to three minutes to speak before I 

ask you to wrap up. 

          Let's see.  Staff, as soon as we have finished all 

that, we'll then continue with a Board discussion.  So Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, Mary, this is Jeff.  I'm 

going to read the names sort of in two so that people know 

when they're on deck.  I apologize for any mispronunciation, 

but please you should in all cases give your own name and 

your address when you begin. 

          So the first speaker is listed as Cynthia Ann Web 

browser, and is followed by Dannie Wang.  You can begin, 

45

Cynthia Ann Webb.     

          [Pause]  

          I think we maybe lost the first speaker -- not an 

auspicious start.  Next speaker is Dannie Wang.  You can 

unmute yourself and begin.   

          DANNIE WANG:  Hi, I have two questions.  The first 

question is --  

and address, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Can you start by giving your name 

          DANNIE WANG:  Oh, yes, sorry.  My name is Dannie 

Wang.  I live on Fulkerson Street, #71.  A really 

interesting presentation, thank you so much for sharing and 

being so transparent.  I have two questions.  My first 

question is, is there going to be -- on the first ground 

floor, are there going to be spaces for retail, or is there 

only going to be office building? 

          My second question is -- and I apologize, I logged 

in a little late so I didn't hear the first parge -- the 

space where the Eversource is, that's going to stay put as

is right now, is that correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the -- I'm just, for everyone's 

benefit, the way this -- this is Jeff again -- the way this 

proceeds with public comment is you give your comments, and 

then we'll get through all the speakers and then there will 

be a time for the Board members to discuss any responses 

with the applicant at the end.   

          DANNIE WANG:  Okay, thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So does that conclude?  Thank you.  

So I will go back to Cynthia Ann Webb at this point.  You 

can begin with your name and address.  

          C.A. WEBB:  Thank you very much.  I'm sorry, my 

Zoom crashed.  Can you hear me now?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you. 

          C.A. WEBB:   C.A. WEBB: Excellent.  So my name is 

C.A. Web browser.  I am the President of the Kendall Square 

Association located at 510 Kendall Street.  I'm also a 

resident in Wellington Harrington. 

          Over the course of the last 30 years, you know 

development in Kendall Square has truly transformed 

underutilized service parking lots and aging industrial 

buildings into the most innovative square mile on the

planet. 

          Today Kendall Square is home to more than half of 

the jobs in Cambridge.  If Kendall Square is to remain the 

world's premier innovation district and an evergreen economy 

for the City of Cambridge, it is essential that thoughtful, 

sustainable new development is undertaken to finish filling 

in those underutilized lots and aging buildings. 

          Alexandria Real Estate's proposed redevelopment of 

325 Binney Street will offer 375,000 square feet of state-

of-the-art, highly sustainable office and lab space at a 

critical location along the proposed Grand Junction Multi-

use Pathway.  

           The concurrent conveyance of the 1800 linear feet 

of the Grand Junction Multi-use Pathway from Binney to 

Cambridge Street, with their contribution to -- for its 

design and construction is essential to the connectivity and 

sustainable transportation needs of the district and of the 

city.   

          Improving these options and decreasing commuting 

times and decreasing the number of drivers coming into 

Cambridge has been and remains a top priority for the 

Kendall Square Association and for our 150 member companies,

including many that you know -- Biogen, Sanofi, Pfizer, 

Takeda and others. 

          This section of the pathway is one of the final 

pieces that will get cyclists and pedestrians to travel from 

the future west station over in Boston over the Charles 

River into Cambridge and connect up to the Somerville 

Community path, as you heard tonight. 

          Kendall Square is the dynamic, economic powerhouse 

that it is because of the power of proximity that it offers 

to MIT's labs and to the rich constellation of 

interdependent biotech and tech companies who've carefully 

chosen to place their homes here. 

          All of that has come into stark relief during this 

pandemic, as we watched not one or two or three but more 

than a dozen companies at the center of vaccine development, 

and at the center of testing innovation, as we all work to 

confront this pandemic. 

          For these reasons, we support Alexandria Real 

Estate's proposed development to create safe, sustainable, 

healthy places for more scientists, engineers and others to 

come together to aid all of our public health and to promote 

the next generation of Innovation Cambridge.  Thank you.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Pamela Van Dort and will be followed by Galen Mook.   

          PAMELA VAN DORT:  Good evening.  This is Pamela 

Van Dort at 13 Cornelius Way.  Can you hear me, Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.   

          PAMELA VAN DORT:  Okay, great.  Thank you.  I live 

in Linden Park, which is one of the closer residential 

neighbors, right by this proposed project, and part of a 

Linden Park Neighborhood Association.  And I'm speaking 

today in support of this petition.   

          We as a neighborhood really appreciate how much 

Alexandria has listened to our office concerns throughout 

this process of the last 18 months that they likely have all 

been involved with together, and appreciate the various 

noise, light and traffic mitigation measures that they have 

put in place as part of this special application, or special 

permit application directly in response to our 

conversations. 

          We also note that it's consistent with zoning.  

And as part of that is the completion and a further step 

forward for a number of important community benefits.   

          One of the most notable to us is the important

step forward it would be for the multiparty negotiation to 

move the proposed substation off of Fulkerson.  That has 

been a big concern for us, and we appreciate that Alexandria 

has offered to put money forward to complete its portion of 

that multiparty deal. 

          So we appreciate your time and consideration of 

our comment, and encourage you to move this petition 

forward.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Galen Mook, who will be followed by Dennis Carlone.   

          GALEN MOOK:  Thank you so much.  Can you hear me?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.  Please start 

with your name and address.   

          GALEN MOOK:  Thank you so much.  My name is Galen 

Mook.  I'm with the Massachusetts Bicycle Coalition, also 

known as Mass Bikes.  I'm actually an Allston resident, I'm 

across the river at 59 Aldie Street in Allston. 

          I'm here to speak on the regional concerns 

regarding the Grand Junction Pathway as part of this 

project, less so on the development itself and the impact on 

Kendall Square and the neighborhood, but the opportunity 

that this project affords the City of Cambridge and in fact

the whole region to connect the pathway network which has 

been in the works for decades, as we all know. 

          And I'm very much in support of this project for 

the purpose of being able to build this crucial, key 

connection of a multi-use pathway system which will connect 

the entire region. 

          Personally, where I live in Allston, we are 

currently also undergoing a design and construction project 

under Mass DOT which would hopefully and ideally help 

connect the Grand Junction Pathway over the Charles River 

and into Cambridgeport, and to connect it on up to MIT and 

beyond.   

          Now, this portion of the Grand Junction Pathway 

will be an absolutely crucial connection to do that 

multiregional link -- basically a keystone portion.   

          So we can imagine that it's not necessarily -- 

it's just a benefit for those in Kendall Square and East 

Cambridge, and in Cambridge in general, but will in fact 

connect to the Grand Junction Pathway through the Green Line 

Extension to the Minuteman Pathway to the Northern Strand 

Pathway eventually and throughout the entire region. 

          So speaking on behalf of the interests of people

who will be riding bikes to and from the area for 

recreation, for commuting, for health and wellness, we are 

in support of this project.  Thank you so much!   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Dennis Carlone, who will be followed by Rachel Burkhardt. 

          DENNIS CARLONE:  Hi.  Thank you, Jeff.  This is 

Dennis Carlone, 9 Washington Avenue in Cambridge.  I'm also 

the co-Chair of the Ordinance Committee at the Council. 

          And as part of the Council review of the original 

zoning petition, we asked the developer, Alexandria, to work 

with the neighbors and to develop a scheme that fit in as 

well as it could.  And as you have seen tonight, since you 

saw the earlier proposals a year ago, this is a pretty 

remarkable project.   

          And you might recall, Planning Board, I rarely say 

that, in that it has mitigated the size, the architecture, 

the landscape, the future Fulkerson power plant has done -- 

they've done everything reasonable -- beyond reason, to make 

this project work; but more importantly, make the area work.   

          I truly want to thank Alexandria, the 

architectural team and the Jay -- DR+A, the sustainable 

consultant.  I have learned a lot.

          I want to add that many of you know I am a 

traditional design architect.  I love using traditional 

materials.  But at the same time, I have to say the 

architects have done a great job to make a warm and inviting 

lab.  That's usually an oxymoron, but in this case it is.   

          And I was very dubious of the wood like material 

being pulled off, and everything I've seen recently proves 

to me that they've done that. 

          I also want to say -- want to point out one thing. 

We all have heard problems of labs being near residential 

areas -- especially acoustic problems.  They are putting a 

slab over the mechanical equipment to contain noise, but 

also to extend the life of mechanical equipment.  I think 

this should be a standard in the city.   

          It also allows the future use of solar on the 

roof, as well as other green roof solutions, including water 

calculation.  I have too salute them dramatically for that. 

          The other things I want to mention is they have 

created an enriched background façade for the new park 

across the street.  These are all things that we talked 

about. 

          And finally, the neighborhood was very involved

from the beginning.  Pamela spoke, but other neighbors were 

involved, and Alexandria welcomed them and encouraged their 

participation beyond any developer I've ever participated 

in.  I believe I was involved with 15 meetings with both, 

and I was impressed in the whole process.  And I'm very 

proud the way the building has come out.  And I know you've 

never heard me say that before.   

          Thank you.  Thank you, Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Councillor.  The next 

speaker is Rachel Burkhardt, what would be the first time 

followed by Jason Stockmann.   

          RACHEL BURKHARDT:  Good evening.  This is Rachal 

Burkhardt, 1429 Cambridge Street in Cambridge.  Can you hear 

me?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.     

          RACHEL BURKHARDT:  Great.  Thank you very much and 

good evening to all.  I'll just mention a brief bit of my 

background first here.   

          I am a member -- cofounder, actually, of The 

Friends of the Grand Junction Path.  And previously as a 

member of the Cambridge Bicycle Committee back in 2001, I 

was the principal author of the report and proposal that

started the Grand Junction Path -- you know, started the 

planning process for them. 

          And so, one of the things from that background I 

wanted to applaud Alexandria for is understanding and 

putting together probably the assembly of the most difficult 

part of it, you know. 

          And they did it exactly as I had envisioned that 

it needed to be done, because there are four different 

landowners that had to be -- they had to work with, and 

they've successfully done that.  So they get an A+ on the 

most difficult part of the Grand Junction for doing that. 

          On behalf of the Friends of the Grand Junction and 

our colleagues in the Friends of the Community Path, you 

know, we do also want to applaud, you know, that not only 

the assembly of this land and the transfer to the city, but 

also the provision of funds to design and construct the 

path.   

          I think folks before me have spoken to the 

connectivity of this path that will connect a lot of places 

here, and to that I can only add that I work over in Boynton 

Yards and, you know, so that will be kind of another area 

that more or less connects into this Grand Junction Pathway

as well. 

important. 

          And that's another area where there will be 

growing tech, and there's a lab building already under 

construction there.  So there's the synergy of connecting 

all of these nodes together I think is going to be really 

          So in conclusion, I just want to -- you know, 

thank Alexandria for reaching out to us and discussing this 

and to say that I look forward to being able to ride on that 

section of the path -- hopefully in the near future.  Thank 

you and good evening.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Jason Stockmann, who will be followed by Jim Gray.   

          JASON STOCKMANN:  Thank you.  This is Jason 

Stockmann from 7 Cornelius Way in Linden Park.  I'd like to 

speak in support of the application.  The first reason is 

that I think the community engagement throughout this 

project was exemplary.   

          You heard earlier from Pam Van Dort, my neighbor, 

how Alexandria worked very closely with the neighborhood to 

address concerns related to acoustics, light traffic, and 

the loading dock.

22

          The second reason is that Alexandria has gone 

above and beyond the call of duty to help facilitate moving 

the Eversource substation from the site. 

          The third reason is their extremely generous 

contribution toward completing the Grand Junction Trail.  

This will provide a fantastic route for bike and pedestrian 

commuters to reach the Job Center in Kendall Square, where 

there's already a high level of bike commuting, and there's 

projection for even higher levels in the future. 

          As a neighbor, I'll benefit from the Grand 

Junction Trail.  I bike every day on Cardinal Medeiros, but 

I've never been comfortable doing so.  Although it's a 

restricted route, it sees heavy levels of truck traffic.   

          The Grand Junction Trail will provide a safe 

turning ground for me, and I'm super excited to have it in 

our neighborhood. 

          I hope that eventually the design will include a 

convenient connection to the Wellington-Harrington 

neighborhood from the trail, somewhere between Binney and 

Cambridge if it's done in a sensitive way addressing any 

concerns from the neighbors, while providing accessibility 

to the path.

          Finally, the third reason or fourth reason I'm 

supportive of this project is that the building is sensitive 

to its context and to the environment.   

          I would applaud Alexandria and the Design Team for 

achieving an extremely high standard for redesign and 

sustainability, and I'm also grateful to them for including 

a Hubway station, which will be helpful both to employees 

working at the building and also, to the neighborhood. 

          And with that, I'd like to conclude my remarks.  

Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is Jim 

Gray, who will be followed by Heather Hoffman.  Jim Gray, 

you can unmute yourself and start.  Thanks.   

          JIM GRAY:  Jim Gray, 2 Michael Way.  Can I be 

heard now?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.   

          JIM GRAY:  So I live in Linden Park neighborhood.  

My neighbors Pam and Jason essentially made all the points 

that I want to make, so I would like to underline what they 

said, which is also largely in a letter, which we submitted.  

          A couple of specifics just to add:  A lot of very 

helpful back and forth over the last year around noise 

59

mitigation and traffic.   

          And I think the biggest concern I had in that 

process was with the traffic, because Cardinal Medeiros 

currently -- as Jason said as well -- is not good for bike 

traffic certainly, but I notice a lot of trucks, and I think 

more trucks than really should be there, according to what 

I've heard.  I've not looked into it in detail. 

          So I just want to say that in the process of going 

back and forth, Alexandria found, you know, some of the 

analysis of traffic and convinced us that most of the 

additional traffic would not be on Cardinal Medeiros; would 

not affect our neighborhood, and that the routes that were 

likely to be affected could handle it. 

          In addition to that, if that turned out not to be 

true, or if the projections were different, you know, we are 

in times where with COVID and other things projections could 

change.  There's some ability to dynamically mitigate 

traffic is my understanding in terms of how, for example, 

the parking facilities are used.   

          So I just want to put it on the record related to 

all of this in the neighborhood and the traffic and the 

different uses is that to the extent that the city does

build in ways to work with the developers to dynamically 

after things have been built to adjust things like traffic -

- I think that's very, very helpful -- and that I would put 

Cardinal Medeiros, you know, on the radar as something that 

could use some help. 

          And, you know, maybe as things develop further, 

the model that we've all been through with this building 

project would be -- could be used with other developments, 

because we as neighbors feel like we've been listened to, 

and results look very positive. 

          So for all those reasons, I am in support of the 

special permit.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Heather Hoffman, who is followed by Charles Hines.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello.  Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  And most of what I'm going to say is going 

to have very laudatory, in keeping with the tone of the 

evening.   

          The first thing I'd like to note is that I think 

that Alexandria learned an awful lot from the last time that 

they had a negotiation with the neighborhood.   

          And I -- from everything that I have heard, 

61

12

13

because I was not directly involved in many of these 

negotiations:  They did a significantly better job this 

time.  And I want to thank them for that, and hope that they 

continue to do better if they have future interests in the 

neighborhood.   

          I also want to thank them for being what I am 

certain is the reason that we -- it looks as though we're 

going to have Eversource move away from the neighborhood.  

It is really nice to be on the same side as a huge developer 

for something like that.   

          And I also noted that one of the things that made 

me very happy was that the specific note on the 

sustainability plans about not lighting up the night sky.  

And Alexandria has been extremely responsive when it turned 

out that somehow lights got put into a building that at 

least the people we had dealt with didn't expect.  And so, 

they have a whole lot of credibility with me at least for 

meaning what they say there.   

          The one thing that I would point out about with 

lights is that I haven't been down there at night recently 

enough to know if this is still the case, but they at least 

had two big lights on poles aimed so as to blind drivers on

Binney Street.   

          If those are still there, I hope that they will 

stop being there.  301 Binney did that as well when it was a 

slab for years and years.  And it's not necessary and it's 

dangerous. 

          I am hopeful this Councillor Carlone is correct; 

that this will make a lab that is compatible with being near 

people's homes.  I don't think that that should be taken as 

a signal for more labs to be right next to our home.  But if 

there's going to be one, I hope that this one really is a 

good neighbor. 

          And my last comment is that I am not particularly 

surprised that the people who are ever so concerned about 

the effects of certain things on housing prices weren’t here 

to ask about why we aren't finding out whether this is going 

to drive up housing prices in the neighborhood. 

          Anyway, good luck with this and thank you.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Before I go to the next 

speaker, who is the last one with hand raised, I'll just -- 

the requisite reminder, if you haven't spoken yet, and you'd 

still like to speak, now's the time to push the button on 

Zoom that says, "Raise hand." Or if you're connected by

phone, you can raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          So while you do that, the last speaker so far is 

Charles Hinds.  You can begin.    

          CHARLES HINDS:  Hi.  My name is Charles Hinds.  I 

live at 207 Charles Street, East Cambridge.  I'm the current 

President of the East Cambridge Planning Team and I'm here 

to speak on behalf. 

          We've submitted a letter to the Planning Board.  I 

just wanted to read a few paragraphs out of it.  I don't 

want to bore you with the letter, but I think some things 

need to be repeated.   

          The proposal was very well received by our 

membership.  Over the past two years, the Linden Park 

Neighborhood Association, ECPT, worked together and 

developed the Grand Junction Zoning, the Office Building 

design and site plan.   

          Alexandria, led by Joe Maguire and Michelle Lauer 

made an unprecedented effort with the two neighborhoods and 

Councillor Carlone, where Alexandria refiled a petition 

three times until mutually acceptable terms were reached 

between the neighborhoods and Alexandria.  The succeeding 

seven months have been spent refining the design to be the

best of all interested parties.   

          I just wanted to go through a few things that the 

neighborhood really liked; the stepped heights, where the 

building heights start at 95 feet at Binney Street stepped 

down to 60, and then to 45 in the residential neighborhood.  

That was very important to the East Cambridge Planning Team.  

Because that was a transitional area, and now this looks 

like a transitional building.   

          The building setback on Binney Street, a 25-foot, 

creates room for pedestrians, a bike raceway, small tree 

plaza at the corner of Binney and Fulkerson.  That was very, 

very good design decision.   

          The open space, including the publicly beneficial 

open space being designed as an urban meadow in the pocket 

park planned on Fulkerson Street adds a secondary entrance.  

          The sustainability design includes 80 geothermal 

wells to dramatically reduce building energy consumption, 

rainwater collection for irrigation, roof-ready solar power, 

LEED goal standard, reduction of glass and the addition of a 

lot of trees. 

          We like the design, and it was designed to reduce 

shadows and maximize the distance from existing small

residences as attractive façades.  And I'd just like to read 

the conclusion. 

          "In conclusion, we join the Linden Park 

Neighborhood Association in support of the special permit 

application and request the Planning Board approve the 

special permit.   

          "We would again like to thank Alexandria for their 

efforts in listening to our concerns and addressing them in 

the zoning site design and benefits package.  We're glad to 

have played a role in this project.  We congratulate 

Michelle Lauer on her promotion to Vice-President, Real 

Estate Development and Community relations at Alexandria, 

and look forward to working with her in the future.   

          "We also send warm wishes to Joe Maguire on his 

retirement from Alexandria.  Thank you."   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  We have one more 

speaker at this point -- Donald Sheehan.  Please unmute 

yourself and you can begin.   

          DONALD SHEEHAN:  Yes, thank you very much.  My 

name is Donald Sheehan.  I represent the International 

Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in the Greater Boston area 

in Cambridge.  I just want to say thanks for the team 

66

effort, both the neighborhood associations and Alexandria 

Realty for their hard work and endurance of spending the 

last couple of years trying to make this project move 

forward. 

          And the last couple of years of the Eversource 

substation being relocated obviously was a tremendous help 

in having this development move forward, and we would just -

- again, like to thank both the community and Alexandria 

Realty Trust for doing such a great job.  We're so glad to 

hear those comments.  Thank you.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  So this will be a last 

call if anybody hasn't spoken yet, and would still like to 

speak.  Please push the Raise Hand" button or *9 on your 

phone.     

          [Pause]  

          I'm not seeing any at this point, so I will turn 

it back over to the Chair.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you, Jeff.  And thank 

you to all of the members of the public who took the time to 

join in this evening and provide their comments; much 

appreciated. 

          We're going to now move from public comment to

Board discussion.  If the project moves to a second public 

hearing, there would be another opportunity for public 

comment at that time, and additional written comments may 

also be submitted. 

          We also received memos on this application from 

staff at the Community Development Department, Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation Department and the Department of 

Public Works, and those members of staff of those 

departments are available to answer any questions the Board 

may have. 

          So as we move to questions, let me just start by 

asking the two that Dannie Wang raised during the public 

comment period, which was, "Is there going to be any ground 

floor retail in the building?" and just sort of an update on 

what is happening with Eversource, because she said she 

missed that portion. 

want to address that?    

          So Michelle, I don't know if you or Jim or -- just 

          MICHELLE LAUER:  Certainly, no problem.  I'm happy 

to jump in to answer the question about the ground-floor 

retail.  We specifically do not have any ground-floor retail 

here at this location.  We do have -- we have relocated the 

68

bike room to the Binney Street side of the building, so that 

we believe that will bring some great activity to the 

ground-floor use. 

          At this point in time, our focus for retail is 

really trying to consolidate retail in places that have a 

larger density of it -- for instance, One Kendall Square 

with the plaza that we have there.  At this point in time, 

the retail market is very challenging.   

          So we're doing what we can to help our existing 

retailers and really focus on making the ground-floor 

pedestrian experience transparent and active with things 

like the bike room and the high level of transparency on the 

first floor along there.  So if that answer the question for 

the ground-floor retail question?   

          The Eversource update I think I will actually pass 

that one over to Jim, who is more up to date on that one.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you, Michelle, thank you 

Madam Chair.  The situation at Eversource is that there are 

two critical steps necessary to effectuate the conveyance of 

this land to Alexandria.   

          The first is the passage of the pending CRA zoning

petition that would allow for this bill, their transformer 

to be located in the MXD District.  So a zoning petition 

needs to be approved and ultimately adopted by the City 

Council. 

city. 

          Secondly, Eversource needs to go through a setting 

approval process once that zoning is in place.  If both of 

those things have positive outcomes -- and there's reason to 

suspect they might -- then Alexandria is prepared, ready, 

willing and able to purchase that land and convey it to the 

          The thinking on the city, from what we've been 

told, is it would likely become part of a public process 

around the disposition of the land.  I'm sure it would come 

as no secret to most people who follow it that the two areas 

of use being discussed are some combination of open space or 

housing.   

          But again, that would be a determination by the 

city.  The conveyance from Alexandria to the city would be 

without restriction, so -- but, as you can imagine, what 

becomes of that space really allows for some rethinking on 

the balance of the publicly beneficial open space.   

          It has one character, obviously, if it's land

located behind the substation.  It has a whole different 

utility and appeal if it's part of a larger open space or 

expanded residential neighborhood, so.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  

So to continue, then, with questions, do any Board members 

have questions either for the applicant or for staff?  And 

you can either raise your hand via, "Raise hand" or just 

state your name and I will recognize you. 

          So questions?  Lou?  Louis Bacci, go ahead.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Are you any closer in making 

a decision on some other areas that are either masonry or 

the concrete or metal panels?  Have you gotten any closer on 

that decision?         

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I'm guessing that Jay or Michelle 

would be best able to answer that?         

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Sure, I can speak to that.  So 

I don't know if you can jump to the slides that have 

materials on them?   

          But we have actually settled on two materials that 

we're working with right now.  So that this first slide here 

you can see the labeled materials.  Tactile is actually a 

thin -- it's a thin, ultra-high-performance concrete panel.

Actually, this is a sample here in my hand, the exact one 

that's on the screen.  So you can see that it's actually 

fairly thin.  But it's actually highly durable.  So --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I recidivism a sample.         

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Yeah, okay.  So yeah, you know 

exactly what it's like, then.  It's essentially a concrete 

panel.  This is also the company that's thinking very 

sustainability.  They actually have a whole section on the 

website that talks about the reduced use of CNET for 

reducing the carbon footprint.  So that's great. 

          The second thing we're doing that you see here on 

the screen is the Pure+FreeForm.  That is a metal panel, but 

we're actually intentionally using that in all of these 

clusters of the window frames to reduce the overall weight 

of the façade.  So that means that everything kind of will 

be reduced structure and so forth.  So that's great. 

          And then what we set out to do from the beginning 

also was that we wanted to continue using the Tactile, so we 

challenged Tactile to actually create a custom color and 

texture that would match the Pure+FreeForm panel.  So that's 

what you see on the next page.  That is actually photographs 

of the large panel that they developed for it.

          So if you could go to slide 24?   

          Yeah.  So these -- this is a big panel, because 

you can see the metal panel that's at the bottom of the page 

in the middle there.  That's the scale of this one that I'm 

holding in my hand, so that this is a much larger panel to 

two-foot tall experiment that you see there in the 

photograph.   

          But the Moore effect that you're seeing there 

actually is a variation in the thickness of the vein in the 

panel, so it's basically replicating the movement of 

essentially a wood grain pattern.  And that's achieved 

through the way light actually interacts with the depth of 

the pattern, and we think they -- we're pretty excited about 

this, because they matched it perfectly. 

          So that will be integrated into the Fulkerson 

Street façades, as I was talking about, as well as in the 

north and northwest façade that's towards the bike path. 

          What's important to note, actually, is that these 

details continue up into the mechanical penthouse area.  So 

we're actually using the details to camouflage all of the 

mechanical penthouse louvers.   

          So they'll be behind the detailing of the façade,

so we always wanted to integrate the entire façade together 

so that there was actually no readable -- you know, you get 

to the penthouse and suddenly it's a metal panel louver 

system.  It's actually all integrated and pretty refined.  

So we're pretty excited about that.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So in the majority, you've 

gone with the concrete, and there won't be any last minute  

--        

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Right.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- façade changes with the 

metal panel?         

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Yeah, that's correct.  I should 

note, you know, the shading screen on the south façade in 

the collaboration spaces we will be working with the metal 

panel on those, on the horizontal louvers that you see 

there, because it also benefits us, due to the lightweight 

material; therefore reducing the weight of the structure as 

well there.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And while I have you here, 

the louvers that basically completely surround the building, 

and the mechanical enclosure.  How transparent will that be?  

Will that be backed by some kind of diffuser or will it be

--        

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- see-through?         

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Yes.  So we're actually -- 

there's the louvers are actually not along the entire 

façade.  They're actually contained in very specific areas.  

So what we're doing -- you know, so you do have mechanical 

louvers behind those areas of course.   

          And what we're doing now is we're actually 

designing a back pane detail, so they will all have the same 

color, but they're going to be behind the vertical screen of 

the Tactile system. 

          So our intent was that regarding the depth of it, 

you'll never actually be able to tell when it's a louver or 

not.  It's just going to be this kind of refined vertical 

rake, with the 50 percent opening that we need to get for 

the louvers to breathe through the façade.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.  That's what I 

thought you were trying to head for.  It looked like the 

complete mechanical enclosure was louvered.  So I guess you 

were successful.         

          JAY SIEBENMORGEN:  Yeah, it's actually -- I don't

know, you could jump to any perspective, actually.  We could 

talk about.  But it'll work so I can list on slide 24 here, 

if you see it's basically a rhythm of a detail that’s in and 

out.   

          So the in panel -- that is the shaded panel you 

see in the rendering on the left -- that is what opens at 

the top to allow the air to go in to the louvers behind.  So 

you'll still have the warm material going up, just within 

that detail is how you open and close the façade.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you.  Any other 

Board members with questions?  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thank you.  So this is either 

for Traffic and Parking or the architects.  The only thing 

I'm not really wild about about this plan is the location of 

the entry to the parking garage, because it's right on the 

front of the building next to the main entry, next to the 

bicycle room, next to the railroad tracks, next to the Grand 

Junction. 

          And I just wonder the rationale for putting it 

there, whether there was discussion about any other 

location, and if so why they were -- those other locations

were rejected?                      

          SELMA MANDZO:  I can actually take this one.  This 

is Selma Mandzo from VHB.  We did actually look at options 

to have the garage be accessed off of Fulkerson.  However, 

due to the restrictions, when you're traveling on Fulkerson, 

there's only certain movements you can make at that 

intersection of Fulkerson and Little Binney.   

          A garage on Fulkerson would basically force all 

the vehicles to either take a sharp right onto Little Binney 

or kind of a -- you know, a ride, straight ride down to 

Galileo.   

          There is now opportunity to take a left onto 

Binney Street and to access clients on the east side. And we 

did, you know, worked with Traffic and Parking, and Little 

Binney was found to be the preferred location for accessing 

to allow for as many different distributions to be available 

to the vehicles as possible to distribute the traffic.    

          JOSEPH BARR:  I guess I'll just add that, you 

know, there's not really -- as you sort of pointed out, 

there's not a great spot for a curb cut anywhere on the site 

that doesn't have negative impacts in one way or another.  

So I think this is probably the best of a set of not very

great options.   

          I do think that as we move further into the 

details of design, we want to work very closely with the 

applicant to make sure that that crossing of the cycle track 

of the sidewalk is safe -- and also, that the relationship 

between the driveway from One Kendall Square and the 

driveway from this building which are fairly close to each 

other and separated by a railroad track are -- you know, 

that we have something that we're comfortable with. 

          So it's definitely challenging, but it's sort of 

the best of a set of not very great options.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  And that was Joseph Barr, 

Director of Traffic, Parking and Transportation.    

          JOSEPH BARR:  Oh, sorry.  Apologies.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted, did you have any other 

questions?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No, I don't.       

          MARY FLYNN:  No?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  That was really my only 

question.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Let's see.  Other Board 

members?  I don't see any other hands.  I do have just a

question on the north open space and the western boundary of 

the project.   

          Is there a way to -- it looks like that acoustical 

fence completely blocks the park off at the north, so that 

you have to come back out onto Fulkerson; I'm just wondering 

if there's any connection that I'm missing that goes between 

the park and the western boundary of the property that would 

enable somebody who, say, was using the Bluebikes to park a 

Bluebike and walk straight back and get to that open space?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Well, if -- would it be possible, 

Madam Chair to put that image up?  It might be helpful --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, I agree.  --      

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  -- to discuss this.  Because we 

did spend a fair bit of time evaluating how to use this.  We 

think that passive open space in the front portion makes 

sense, and it's intended.  We've only -- at the moment we 

only have a limited bit of frontage onto Fulkerson Street.  

          But that's intended to become a point of 

pedestrian access into the open space area.  It's not so 

much that the berm divides the access, it's beyond the berm, 

it's well beyond the berm. It's -- you can see where there's 

kind of a circle and we're describing it as a fence, but

it's going to be heavily planted. 

          The idea is that they're -- in what we're calling 

the meadow area, we're concerned that that would become 

under the current configuration with the building that 

fronts it now, an uncertainty over what might happen in the 

front parcel.  That would become -- could provide certain 

challenges.     

          It's not going to be a gated space in Fulkerson 

Street.  The idea is you could walk into it, and the public 

is welcome to -- there will be benches, there will be paths 

-- but there does come a point in the current geometry of 

that space where portions of it would be beyond visual 

control. 

          There is a requirement for a planter along the 

edge abutting the rails, so we're going to have a 25-foot 

planter there.  So that's also going to cut down on the 

ability to see what's going on in there.   

          So for those reasons, we've come up with this 

plan, but this does provide us an opportunity to say that we 

would suggest and respectfully request the Board consider 

language in its decision that would allow for flexible 

modifications to this open space, depending on what the

outcome of the Eversource land is.   

          Because it's clear to see that it could become 

more accessible, and the security risks that are present 

with it in its current configuration could be mitigated with 

a change in the ownership of the land in the front.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  I understand your point, and I 

think it's a very good one.  I think the screening is very, 

very effective.  I think that, you know, the view from the 

neighborhood is very responsive to the comments that we were 

hearing in earlier discussions on the zoning about the 

neighborhood, you know, looking at the project. 

          But it does seem to me as though -- I realize that 

western boundary, which is at the top of this slide, you 

know, is part of that is emergency access -- but, you know, 

particularly if this did become more active over time, you 

know, you are going to have a lot of foot traffic going in 

front of the building and coming from the west.   

          So I think it just might be interesting to 

explore, like, how would you get from the Bluebikes station, 

could you get from that station along that western corridor 

which right now. 

          I mean, I suppose you could -- if it's all grass,

you just keep -- it doesn't look like there's any fences in 

there.  But the transition between sort of that kind of 

walkway to the grass sort of makes you feel like maybe you 

shouldn't step through there.   

          Anyway, I think you're right, it's -- over time, 

as is the flexibility of the space is better known, I think 

it's something that could be worked on.  So yeah, that does 

clarify.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  And the other point worth 

mentioning:  one of the reasons that this building is able 

to achieve such notable sustainability measures is the 

presence of the geothermal wells --       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.       

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  -- which is not, and that 

opportunity, frankly, doesn't exist on many sites.  So the 

wells will all be on that area, and so, there will be need 

to access the wells to do maintenance.   

          They're not -- they won't protrude above the 

ground, and to the untrained eye, there wouldn't be any 

understanding that they were there.  But they do present 

some additional logistical challenges in terms of future 

access.       

82

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.  Yeah.  Actually, I think, you 

know, the idea of a meadow is quite lovely, actually.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  There aren't very many in the city 

that I'm aware of, so.      

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yeah, and you should hear the 

landscape people talk about the butterflies and all the 

things that can go on in there.  But --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  We knew we were limited on time, 

so.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay, all right.  Well, I 

appreciate your good judgment on that one.  All right, let's 

see.  Are there any other questions?  Lou, I see your hand 

up, but I think that's from your previous question.  If I'm 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  No, I've got a quick one.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, you do.  Okay, very good.  Go 

incorrect --  

ahead.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Since we were on the 

geothermal wells, just a quick question, how much of a 

percentage of the approaching Net Zero would the -- do the

geothermal wells contribute to this project?  Quite a bit, I 

would expect?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yes.  Madam Chair, through you 

Jacob from BR+A would be our resident expert, if he could 

respond?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Sure.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  Yeah, I can pull -- actually, if 

you give me just a minute, I can pull up the actual number, 

because we did do a calculation of that specific question.  

It may just take me a minute to get to it.  If you want to 

go to the next question, then I can come back to that in a 

moment.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  I don't know that there are -- 

I'm not seeing any other hands, so is there another slide 

that you need to get to, is that it?   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  Yeah, I'm just pulling up the 

reports, so I make sure --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  -- accurately represent their 

results here.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I have another brief 

question while they're pulling?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Go ahead, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So in the hopefully unlikely 

event that Alexandria cannot acquire the Eversource site, 

then what happens?  Alexandria pays the city, gives the city 

$13 million dollars?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  The short answer to that is yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And then the city -- it's 

for public use earmarked at all, or it's again up to the 

city to decide what it's going to do with it?   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  I'm reading, Mr. Cohen, from the 

commitment letter if, despite reasonable efforts we can't 

acquire the land, Alexandria will contribute the money to a 

designee identified by the city, and this paragraph shall be 

of no further force or effect. 

          So we could give the money to the city, or the 

city could direct us to give the money to a not-for-profit 

development or something like that presumably.  But it's 

spelled out in the Letter of Commitment. 

          It came up late in the process -- well, okay, 

since Alexandria committed to the land, they must already

have that in the budget.   

          So if they don't get the land to give to the city, 

we can skip the land transaction and just give the money to 

the city.  So it was effective negotiation on the part of 

city representatives.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That's what we're all in 

favor of.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Exactly.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  All right, I'm happy to answer the 

other question if there's time?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you Jacob.  Go ahead.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  So although the ground source 

borefield represents a relatively small percent of the peak 

capacity of the heating plan, the only times the peak 

heating capacity is used is under very extreme winter 

conditions.  Most of the time, the geothermal borefield is 

running and doing a lot of the work. 

          And so, on an annual basis, you look at the total 

year, and you look at the geothermal borefield and the heat 

pump chillers that are connected to that, they produce 75 

percent of the annual heating energy from the building.  

It's pretty remarkable, right?

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  So it's amazing what you can 

achieve with a, you know, right size system.       

          MARY FLYNN:  That is remarkable.  It's -- the 

whole, you know, all of the sustainability measures I think 

are just really interesting the way they've all been layered 

and used a variety of solutions for each of the problems 

that --  

          JACOB KNOWLES:  Yeah, I should clarify one other 

piece, which is that that figure of 75 percent does not 

include the humidification, which was added really as a 

COVID mitigation measure for improving the indoor health of 

the occupants.   

          So there is a component of steam that's used to 

humidify the air that's in addition to that thermal energy.  

But the 75 percent is representing the heating energy for 

the building, separate from humidification.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, thank you.  And one 

follow up?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.

to incorporate a blue roof somewhere on this project.  I'm 

just curious if it's still in the plan?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Jacob, would that be a question 

you could address?   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  That is a good question.   I know 

that we are dealing with stormwater through a couple of 

different measures, which include the roof catchment area 

and attributing that into cisterns, capturing that for reuse 

for cooling tower makeup and irrigation. 

          I know that because we have the cisterns there was 

some discussion around whether the blue roof was necessary?  

I don't recall if it is currently part of the design, but 

the intent is to capture the stormwater and to reuse as much 

of it as we can.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I was curious.  It 

seemed like it was a smaller blue roof to begin with, so I 

guess you probably could get rid of it.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  Yeah, I don't know if Michelle 

maybe recalls the exact status, but -- oh, it looks like 

Cathy Bell from NBBJ?     

          CATHY BELL:  Yes.  Hi, this is Cathy Bell from 

NBBJ.  We do have a blue roof system.  That's where we 

88

capture this water that Jacob just mentioned.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay.  So that was retained?     

          CATHY BELL:  Yes, it was.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.                 

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.   

          JACOB KNOWLES:  Thanks, Cathy.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.  All right, Thanks, Lou and -- 

okay, so seeing no other questions at this point from Board 

members, why don't we move on to Board member comment and, 

you know, certainly if additional questions come up in the 

course of that discussion, we will address them.   

          So why don't we begin with the architect who's 

present this evening on our team?  Hugh, would you like to 

begin the discussion?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Certainly. In general, I think this 

is really -- the building's really very well done.  The 

massing works, the punch windows, the colors.  The energy 

performance sets a new, higher standard for such buildings 

in the city.   

          The contributions to get the Grand Junction 

Pathway and to try to reuse the Eversource site for the

benefit of the neighbor in the city is really extraordinary. 

          But there's one thing about the design that I find 

very troubling.  And that's the coloration of the projecting 

meeting spaces.  It looks to me like there's been some 

terrible accident -- maybe an earthquake, maybe an 

explosion, and the building is cracking apart and the 

interior filling's flying out and dripping down. 

          So -- and it doesn't apparently have to be that 

way.  The special permit application that we received on 

page 60 is something called a, "Concept Model."  And it 

shows the massing of the building, and it shows that the 

spandrels are all matching the white color of the building.  

          And looked at that way, it seems to fit.  The 

building gets knit back together; it's no longer flying 

parts.  But of course there's no infill shown on that page 

60.  And when you infill the meeting spaces, build the south 

wall, you basically end up with something that you can't see 

through during the day.   

          You can see through it in the evening, but during 

the day the reflections off the glass, particularly of the 

sky, mean that you can't appreciate what's going on inside.   

          Now, if you look carefully at the renderings on 

90

pages 21, 22 and the elevations on page 55 and 56 of the 

application, it shows that the bottom spandrel of the 

meeting spaces is white, matching the color of the adjacent. 

          And it helps to knit the building together.  I 

think not only should the bottom be white, but the top 

spandrel should be white.   

          I mean, the HAM is a bold stroke in the building, 

and the meeting rooms and how the HAM works is really pretty 

exciting and terrific, and it deserves to be seen.  The 

glazing on the skylight is a huge overkill.  The vertical 

glass, and then the horizon skylights.  It would let in much 

too much light and heat; I think you already referred to 

that. 

          You have to reduce the transparency of those 

elements down to work energetically.  It might be as little 

as 10 to 20 percent transparent.   

          So the summary is we need to use the projecting 

meeting spaces in the penthouse wall that tie together the 

two sides of the building into a coherent whole.  The 

spandrel and caps need to be white concrete.   

          The penthouse wall needs to be the same color; 

perhaps not the full height -- maybe the penthouse on the

left side is higher than the penthouse on the right side, 

where there's a setback.  Maybe the penthouse wall is -- 

that's on the right side, that height, carries over, 

although it isn't that plane, it's actually the other plane 

that's carrying over. 

          It could be concrete or how about making it a 

translucent material that during the day looks like it's the 

same solidity as the concrete and the same color, but at 

night it glows?  That needs work.   

          Now, you still have to infill the walls of the 

meeting spaces.  And right now the scale of the sunshades is 

really very, very tiny.  It's a texture, it's done -- you're 

out in the elements.   

          NBBJ has designed the building in Parcel His in 

Cambridge Crossing.  Look at the building at Parcel JK, a 

couple blocks down the street.  They have some very 

interesting south-facing sunshades that seem to scale a lot 

better to the building.   

          So I think that needs to be worked on.  So my son 

bottom line is that -- those material choices in that part 

of the building is what I'm interested in.  I'm not 

interested in making big massing changes.  For that reason,

I think we can actually approve the building with the 

condition that says, "Work some more on this, work with 

          I have two other comments that were stimulated by 

Erik's memo.  I agree that we need more trees and larger 

trees along the streets, maybe in between the bore holes, 

you know, coming in more on the meadow.  You know, we're in     

an urban forest crisis in the city, and I think you can do 

Erik."  

more. 

          And the other -- one of Erik's suggestions is that 

the building come out closer to the paved areas of Binney 

Street.  And that I would disagree with.  I think having the 

open space on the corner, having a little space between the 

building for some landscape treatments is very desirable.  I 

like the way you've done it, and I would not agree to change 

it. 

          So those are my comments.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Hugh.  Steven Cohen, could 

we go to you next, please?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure.  I guess first I just have 

to defer to Hugh on some of the design details.  But looking 

at it from my perspective of from a more general

perspective, I say from a design perspective and 

environmental perspective and a community perspective, that 

the developers have done a great job.  It's really a role 

model for a large development in the city. 

          So again, while I defer to the architects on the 

details, big picture I think it's an excellent job, a good 

design and a good proposal that will ultimately deserve 

approval.       

why don't you go next?    

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you very much.  Lou, 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I also agree.  I like the 

small plaza on the corner, on the setback of the building.  

I do have a question on that, though.   

          In some locations, like adjacent to that plaza, 

are we expecting to get large canopy street trees, or are 

there going to be large canopy trees in the planting of that 

plaza?  And a few other places around the building look like 

they could use large canopy trees.   

          I don't know if the specified species in this 

would be considered large canopy.  I don't know if anybody 

would like to tackle that one, but on a whole, I think 

you've done an excellent job.  The wood like texture and

finish on a lot of this stuff, there is an awful lot of this 

around this building.  It kind of worries me, but I'm going 

to go with you. 

          But yeah, like I said there are a few locations; 

the Fulkerson Street entrance, the corner; they look like 

they could use some substantial shade trees.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Michelle, would Rob Adams be on 

the call, or could someone from -- 

          ROBERT ADAMS:  I am.       

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  -- oh, maybe -- Rob, you've got 

to introduce yourself.  Madam Chair, he's our -- Rob's a 

landscape architect --        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.       

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  -- with Halverson, and he could 

speak to Mr. Bacci's question.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  That would be helpful, 

thank you.   

          ROBERT ADAMS:  Yeah, thanks, Madam Chair.  It's 

Robert Adams with Halverson Design.  Our office is 25 

Kingston, Boston.   

          Yes, agreed on the idea of providing some overhead 

shades and overhead texture.  The spaces, while they're

important, aren't that large.  And so, we are proposing some 

medium-sized trees.   

          I don't know how much you want to geek out on 

species, but maybe a yellowwood and or two in that Fulkerson 

Street plaza; they're a smaller tree, or a medium-size tree, 

not that dense, but have a high branching structure and get 

some good canopy.  We didn't want to fill the space, right?  

We want to have some mass and some void.   

          And then on the corner of Fulkerson, we've been 

talking about maybe using some gingko trees, kind of in a 

cluster, almost a bouquet, if you will.  It's a technique 

we've used pretty successfully in the seaport and other 

areas.  They're very slow growing, maybe as you know, and we 

could limit their -- and in the urban conditions their 

growth wouldn't overtake the building. 

          And so, yes, proposing trees on the corner in 

small groups and clusters, as well as in the Fulkerson 

courtyard, but not promoting -- you know, giant oaks or big, 

dense maples; something thinner and medium in scale.  And 

frankly --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  How about a sycamore, 

considering there's a lot of them on Binney Street?   

96

          ROBERT ADAMS:  Yeah, the London plane sycamores 

and London planes are a good street tree choice as well.  

They're -- unfortunately, there's a lot of urban disease 

associated with them right now.  We've had a lot of luck 

with some of the hybrid elms.  But yeah, we're exploring a 

lot of different species.   

          I think our overall concept is obviously not a 

monoculture, but to provide a variety of overhead shade 

trees, in case, you know, the future Dutch Elm or Ash Borer 

or whatever comes around, that we're protected from a 

diversity point of view.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Right.  And the locations I 

was talking about were really more of the street tree 

locations in front of the plazas.  I know you don't want to 

probably get inside the --  

          ROBERT ADAMS:  Yeah.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- footprint with a bigger 

tree?   

          ROBERT ADAMS:  Yeah, so -- yeah, sorry.  So then 

along the street trees, yeah, a Patriot Elm, maybe ginkgoes 

on the street trees, but yeah -- London Planes, we may 

pursue those.  We'll have to, obviously talk about a

maintenance program with those.  But yeah, that's a very 

real possibility.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  And we have been dealing with DPW 

-- Cara Felice (phonetic) and her team using/taking our 

queues from the Urban Forest Master Plan on the spacing of 

the trees.  So that's an ongoing -- ultimately it will be 

their call, since the trees are in the public way.  But, you 

know, we'll respond to whatever they conclude.   

          ROBERT ADAMS:  Yeah, definitely.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  My thought was 

instead of a single line down Fulkerson Street of all the 

same species, you might be able to break that up in the 

center with a larger canopy tree, also on the corner.  That 

was the thinking.   

that.       

          ROBERT ADAMS:  Yeah, we can definitely look into 

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right, thanks.  Lou, did 

you have anything else that you wanted to add?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  No, that's it.  Okay.  All 

right.  So then let's -- let me see.  Why don't I -- yeah, 

ask Niko, what are your thoughts?                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Hey.  I don't have anything to

add.  And I think it's a good project.  And I am happy to 

see the changes that have been made since the first time we 

took a look at it.   

          And I am emphatically not an architect, and so, 

I'll refrain from adding my amateur speculations about how 

it could be improved.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  My speculations would be in 

the same category -- total amateur.  Hence, I appreciate 

your remarks.  Ted? Let's move to you.    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.  Well, I like the 

building a lot.  I mean, I think it's really unique and 

different, and, you know, I'm perfectly content with the way 

it looks right now, with the materials and the coloration.  

          You know, I'm not an architect either, so I can't 

quite visualize the things that Hugh is suggesting.   

          I was just going to say that, you know, I'm very 

happy with it just the way it is.   

          I also agree that I think the little corner park 

should remain, and when I read the CDD's comments that it 

should be closer to the street, that seems wrong to me.   

          Also, I didn't quite understand why it was viewed 

as somehow distracting from the future Binney Park across

the street.  It seems to me they work together beautifully.  

And I'm very happy with it just the way it is.   

          You know, I really have nothing else to say.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Well, I'm in 

agreement with what my colleagues are saying.  I, like Ted, 

like the building the way it is, but also am perfectly 

willing to defer to Hugh's expertise.  So I have no 

objections to further study on that whole façade with Erik 

and his team. 

          The -- I think overall the project is really a 

significant one for the city.  I mean, it not only makes a 

beautiful statement on that corner and makes a lovely 

transition I think to the neighborhood, but the 

sustainability aspects of it as well I think are tremendous.  

          And I do think the public process on this was 

approached in a very, very positive manner and resulted in 

what we see today, which is just so different in some ways 

from what we originally saw.   

          You know, I think it really shows how the 

collaboration between the development team and a 

neighborhood can make a project so much better, and make it 

such an important part of the urban fabric.

22

          So I applaud both the neighborhood and the City 

Council and all of the Community Development team and all of 

the Development Team who worked so hard on it, I think.  

Because I think you've just done a wonderful job. 

          The -- yes, so I think the design is -- that 

element is the one thing to continue to think about.  So I 

think based on what I've heard from the Board that we are 

prepared to go ahead and make a decision and take action on 

this item.   

          So if there are -- we'll have to make some 

findings, obviously, but if anyone has objections to moving 

forward with this, with trying to find -- determine the 

findings and grant the permit, now is the time to just speak 

up.  But I think we're all on the same page that we want to 

move forward, okay. 

          So in order to grant the special permit, the Board 

needs to find the proposal meets the following criteria.  

And these are summarized in the Community Development 

Department memo:   

          Under the Project Review Special Permit, which is 

Section 19.20, we would have to find that the project will 

have no substantial adverse impact on city traffic within 

101

the study area, upon review of the traffic impact indicators 

analyzed in the Transportation Impact Study and mitigation 

efforts proposed. 

          And we note that the TIS has been accepted by 

Traffic and Parking.  They've worked closely with the 

applicant and have put together a mitigation package to 

address any areas of concern. 

          The project is consistent with the Urban Design 

objectives of the city, as set forth in Section 19.30, which 

is also in the memo.  It's very detailed, so I won't go into 

it, but I know Board members are familiar with it. Community 

Development has listed a number of items for ongoing review, 

and Hugh has now added to that tonight, in terms of the 

design of the façade. 

we can make that finding. 

          So we will attach those as conditions, but I think 

          The second permit is the Grand Junction Pathway 

Overlay District special permit, which is Section 20.1000.  

And the findings there are that provision has been made for 

the conveyance to the city or designee thereof; by fee or 

easement of interest in certain land as described in Section 

20.1000…

          For the development of the Grand Junction Pathway 

between Binney Street and Cambridge Street.  And we've heard 

tonight that there is an agreement in place to do that. 

          Another finding is the project provides open 

space, recreational opportunities, a corridor for non-auto 

traffic in the city, as well as high-quality development, 

and promotes the goals of public health, safety, welfare and 

economic development.   

          And I think from what we've heard tonight, all of 

those criteria have been -- that criteria has been met as 

well. 

          And then the last one is the General Special 

Permit Criteria, which is Section 10.43, that we have 

addressed in all special permit hearings, and the Board is 

familiar with those, so I won't go into those.  But I think 

that you have been addressed in the applicant's 

presentation. 

          So let's see here.  The staff memos contain 

suggested conditions to be included in the special permit 

decision.  First, let me just ask, is everyone in agreement 

that we can make the findings?     

          [Pause]

          Hearing no objections, I will assume that's a yes 

from everyone.  Okay.  So, again, the Staff memos have 

suggested conditions.  There were a few others from Hugh 

that will be entered into the -- that had been entered into 

the record, and will be attached to the permit. 

          And are there any other conditions that the Board 

would like to attach?  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I just want to be clear 

on something.  So the Traffic and Parking memo has several 

conditions --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Correct.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- including the $250,000 for 

the Kendall Square Shuttle Study.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  But we're also -- I'm used to 

seeing a lot of other conditions from Traffic and Parking, 

and I'm wondering whether they've already been incorporated 

into the PTDM plan, and that therefore they don't have to 

become part of the special permit?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Good question.  Joe, can you answer 

that?    

          JOSEPH BARR:  Sure.  For the record, Joseph Barr,

Director of Traffic, Parking and Transportation.  [Try to 

get it right this time.]   

          So yes, the -- for projects where there's a PTDM 

plan, which this one does, because it's creating new parking 

-- most all of the TDM conditions are aimed in that 

document, which has been finalized and approved by the PTDM 

Planning Officers.   

          So these are just a few additional items that are 

more infrastructure mitigation, which is generally not 

included in the PTDM plan.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Great, thank you.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  There is also a memo from 

Public Works that, as I recall, laid out a few items for 

continuing review.  So that memo would be attached to the 

permit, for your reference.   

          Are there any suggestions from Staff?  Jeff, do 

you have everything you need, or are we missing something?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The -- thank you, Mary -- the only 

thing I would suggest if, for fear of kind of putting Erik 

Thorkildsen on the spot, I just want to make sure that we 

have -- that he has the guidance he needs to proceed with 

the detailed material review, based on the Board's

discussion.  Because I know I heard a couple different 

comments from the different Board members.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  So Erik, we're 

putting you on the spot.  Do you want to respond in any way, 

is there anything of concern to you, or was that all clear?  

          If there's a -- you know, a difference of opinion 

on the corner, several Board members like it -- I think it 

was Hugh who raised some concern; I think it was Hugh, I 

might be wrong.  But anyway, Erik, we're putting you on the 

spot.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay, well just by memory I 

think we have the materials used in those projecting 

collaborative spaces, particularly the spandrels, the sort 

of scale and grain of the sun shading, the coloration and 

maybe adjustments to the height of the penthouse; all of 

these trying to create more -- kind of a stronger 

relationship between the left part of the façade and the 

right part of this façade across that central zone and sort 

of reduce its -- the way Hugh described it as a sort of, you 

know, a sort of disruptive element within that with the 

façade. 

          I think those were the high points; I can go back 

106

through my notes, but were there others that you could look 

at?  Penthouse, sun shading, coloration, particular 

spandrels, but maybe also of the sun shades themselves?              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  This is Hugh.  Yes, we've got it.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.       

          MARY FLYNN:  And I think the other point that was 

raised a couple times was trees.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah, sure.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Four trees and larger trees were 

possible.   I know it was also mentioned in the Public Works 

letter, and that there was reference to the Urban Tree 

Study.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Madam Chair, my apologies for 

interrupting, but I note at page 13 of the Community 

Development memo, there are about eight bullets that 

proposes (sic) on continuing Design Review.         

          MARY FLYNN:  That's right.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I think it summarizes most of the 

issues that have just been brought to the attention of the 

Board.  You might find it helpful to include that language 

as capturing what's being passed to Mr. Thorkildsen.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Right. And those items, the

continuing review items, are normally --      

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Right, a standard condition in 

decisions.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, yeah.  So I -- you know, just 

because Hugh was so detailed in his remarks, it was useful 

to just make sure that those were captured correctly.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And thank you Mary and Erik for 

indulging me.  I always just like to make sure that we 

confirm that we have clarity on the intent of the Board 

before we go ahead, and then for fear of later on realizing 

we're not really sure what the Board wanted us to do.  So 

that's helpful, thanks.       

          MARY FLYNN:  You're welcome.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Hugh?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think I would like to have the 

decision reference the commitment to controlling the spilled 

light from the building towards the residential area.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It's in the application, but I 

think it should also be in the decision.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Called out -- yes, yeah.  I

think the decision can -- you know, highlight a lot of the 

mitigation issues that the applicant has put in place, and 

yes, the lighting is critical, I agree.  All right.  So 

we'll add that.  All right.  Any other comments from the 

Board before we move forward?  Okay. 

          So is there a motion then, to grant the requested 

special permit with those conditions, based on the Board's 

finding that the applicable special permit criteria are met?  

And that is with all the conditions that we've talked about 

-- items that are referenced in the memos, and what we've 

talked about tonight?  So if somebody would like to make 

that motion, would you please say your name?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Hugh has made a motion.  Is 

there a second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Louis Bacci?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis Bacci.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Louis Bacci seconds.  So Jeff, 

could we have a roll call vote, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  On the motion to grant the 

special permit, Louis Bacci?  On the motion to grant the

          [All vote YES]                 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all six members present 

voting in favor.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you, everyone and 

congratulations to the applicant.  And again, thank you for 

all your excellent work.  We -- I'm sure we'll be hearing 

more from staff as you work through the last -- not the 

110

last, but the next phases of design, et cetera.  So 

congratulations.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you, Madam Chair, although 

this has proven to be a costly meeting, because there was 

such high level of confidence on members of this design 

team, they felt this could be accomplished in a single 

meeting.  And I cautioned them that that was not likely to 

happen, and they should not plan for that.   

          So a pool emerged, and I'm on the losing end of 

that pool.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh!    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I'm happy to do so.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, I'm sorry for you but, you 

know, I'm glad --    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  No, that's -- in my world that's 

money well spent.  I hope this is a trend we see continue.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Good.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you very much.       

          MARY FLYNN:  You're welcome.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you again for all your 

time.

Sitting Members:  Mary T. Flynn, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven   

                  A. Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, and Hugh 

Russell 

                 MARY FLYNN:  All right.  So we have another 

item on the agenda, which is a Design Update.  But I'm going 

to propose that we take a five-minute break.  And so, it's 

8:50 right now.  Let's reconvene at 8:55 and we'll talk 

about 55 Wheeler Street.   

[BREAK]   

          So we are going to have a Design Update on Case 

PB#330, which is a previously granted special permit for a 

residential development at 55 Wheeler Street.  And Erik 

Thorkildsen is going to begin by explaining why this is 

before us this evening.  Erik, I'll turn it over to you.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Good evening.  Thank you, Madam 

Chair.  Let's see.  The Planning Board granted a special 

permit in 2018 for this development of a 525 unit 

residential building.  The project is subject to continuing 

Design Review by CDD staff.  Some design changes have been 

made that staff wanted to review with the Board for your

feedback.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And so, the presenter this 

evening is Evan Staples from Toll Brothers.  If you would 

please begin by introducing yourself and any other speakers 

on your team, and then commence your presentation, and we 

hope you will be as concise as possible.  Thank you.   

          EVAN STAPLES:  Of course, Madam Chair.  Thank you 

very much.  And thank you all Board members for your time 

this evening.  My name is Evan Staples.  I'm a Project 

Manager with Toll Brothers Apartment Living, the new owners 

of 55 Wheeler Street.   

          I'll be presenting a portion of our documents 

tonight, along with Ed Hodges, Principal at DiMella Shaffer 

Associates, who is the architect of record and has been 

since the inception of this project.   

          And just as a brief overview, this project was 

permitted under Westbrook Partners, who subsequently sold 

the property and development to Holbrook Toll Brothers 

Apartment Living, and we are extending the design 

development and working through our permitting and 

construction now.   

          We have obtained our site improvement permit, and

are currently under mass excavation efforts and the 

beginning of our foundation placement, just as an overall 

construction update.   

          All things considered, this project is very much 

the same as it was at the time of Planning Board decision;  

525 units, 99 inclusionary units ranging from studio to 

three-bed rental apartments, and through the evolution we 

have been promoting and continuing the design development 

with participation from various departments of the city of 

Cambridge, some of which have gone through a lot of 

development. 

          That I think is why Erik and members of CDD wanted 

us to come in front of you today, including the Wheeler 

Street and Fawcett Street improvements, to be deeded to the 

city at the end of the project, as well as some landscaping 

and north park efforts. 

          We are very excited to be part of this project and 

part of the community, and being able to provide pedestrian, 

vehicular access through these areas of Alewife and, you 

know, are excited to present it to you today.  We're very 

proud of the project, and excited to continue moving 

forward.

          So I will turn it over to Ed Hodges, as I 

mentioned: Principal of DiMella Shaffer, who can talk 

through some of the specific points that we have reviewed 

with CDD, and have been elected to bring in front of you 

today.  Thank you.     

                    ED HODGES:  Thanks, Evan.  I'm Ed Hodges 

from DiMella Shaffer.  Just want to thank the Planning Board 

and the CCD Staff for finding a way to work through the 

situation so that we can keep our profession and projects 

moving; it's very helpful and very interesting to watch the 

previous project come through.  It was quite nice. 

          As Evan said, this project is largely the same, 

even though it's been developing over a couple years.  So 

this is really the evolution of the design in terms of 

materials putting all the guts in the building and getting 

everything to work, and bringing it to the level for 

construction. 

          What you're going to see tonight is the original 

elevations, which are labeled, "2017" because our last 

presentation was at that time, and the permit was granted in 

January of 2018. 

          And then the working drawings colored below as a

comparative analysis, you're going to see that we have, you 

know, designed the building originally playing off with 

texture and smooth materials.   

          And some of the changes are just in those smooth 

materials.  But largely, everything is the same, and you can 

see here it's essentially the same project that -- the 

colors are a little bit different between the rendering 

software and the AutoCAD software.   

          So some of that -- you saw the materials, and the 

mockup's under construction, so you'll be able to go out and 

see the mockup.  So we'll just run through this pretty 

quickly. 

          So Swaathi, if you can give us the next slide?   

          So this is Building A, which is the first building 

as you come in off Wheeler Street.  It's next to the 

Reservoir Lofts.  It has clapboard siding -- the artisan 

clapboard siding on it.  Toll Brothers has a national buying 

agreement with Anderson Windows.   

          And so, the windows in the project had changed to 

Andersen, once Toll came on board.   So there was some 

adjustment there in terms of the colors.  So this is a 

sandstone color that we picked. 

116

18

20

21

22

          And we originally showed metal panel in between 

the windows, but we've switched that to fiber cement here.  

So it's still a smooth panel.  It conveys the same 

aesthetic.  The colors are slightly different, because the 

Andersen windows have the sand tones, so the fiber cement 

panel will be matched to that.  So the overall aesthetic 

effect is the same. 

          And the other change here is we had showed glass 

balconies on the upper floors, and we had shown balconies 

with railings on the lower floors, and Toll Brothers' 

maintenance staff, they don't really like the glass 

balconies in terms of the tenants don't clean them, and 

they're not clear, so we've changed all the balconies on the 

project to be a consistent vertical picket design, which you 

see in the red boxes in the center. 

          Next slide, Swaathi? 

          So you'll see some of this is a consistent theme 

throughout the project.  So here the same change occurred 

from metal panel in between the windows.  The siding is 

still a metal panel, the overall siding on the building.  

This is the smooth red zinc, and the balcony changed to 

vertical pickets for all the balconies on all levels of the

building.   

          Next slide, Swaathi?   

          Then this is Building Be on Wheeler Street.  So 

this is really the next façade down -- excuse me for not 

explaining, but the previous façade was on the Muse of 

Building A.   

          This is Building B on Wheeler Street; this is the 

façade that bends in away from the street.  So a similar 

change here to the balconies, and the panels between the 

windows, which sort of group the windows into these figures 

in the elevation.  They switch from metal panel to fiber 

cement. 

          And then at the ground level, you may remember 

this is two floors of concrete with five floors of wood on 

top of it.  Our original idea was to express the concrete 

structure on the first two levels. 

          As we work through the building various things 

happened in terms of being able to rhythm those columns, 

because we're -- this is bending against the parking grid, 

and so, the columns got a little bit irregular, so we needed 

to be able to build in other columns to get the regularity 

of the façade back.

22

          We had called this out to be stucco on top of the 

concrete.  So we're really doing exterior finish 

installation system, which essentially is synthetic stucco, 

because it gives us the monolithic surfaces that we were 

after in terms of sort of what would be the expression of 

the concrete frame.   

          And it gives us the additional benefit of being 

able to insulate the concrete with three inches of 

insulation.  And it doesn't need the same kind of jointing 

in terms of cracking, so we're able to get the long spandrel 

beams and put the joints in places it makes sense. 

          Next slide, Swaathi?   

          This is the interior of the courtyard.  So here a 

similar change.  We had these green accent panels.  The 

balconies -- you know, been through that, so you know that's 

gone to the vertical picket.  

           And we have settled on instead of just picking a 

green color, which could go out of style in the future, we 

have a really good -- you'll see it when you see the mockup 

-- simulation of a patinaed copper panel, so that the 

building really has these metal finishes on it that will, 

you know, sort of have the patina over time as opposed to

the colors fading.  And so, that's the change here in the 

interior courtyard façades.   

          Next slide, Swaathi? 

          Then here, these are the ends of the buildings.  

We called them the, "hoods" I think when we presented to 

you.  And this is just showing that the ground floor system 

will be the IFS system in lieu of the concrete stucco.   

          Next slide, please? 

          Also, as we evolve the design with the two floors 

of postings and concrete slabs, we ended up with a lot of 

vertical shafts around the columns, which created a whole 

bunch of structural problems in terms of not being able to 

have enough shear in the slab.  So the slab would have had 

to get very thick.   

          So in addition to that, we're doing LEED for 

Homes, and LEED for homes requires compartmentalization of 

the units.  And so, these vertical shafts going through 

created this chimney effect, which counter -- the 

compartmentalization that we needed in the units, and that 

combined with the structural problem that was created by 

having the shafts near the columns.   

          So we needed to vent and keep each unit have its

own compromise in terms of the ventilation.  So the 

ventilation would come to the façade.   

          We've worked really hard on this and tried to 

learn from other projects that have been done in terms of 

our corrugated design.  So it's a slightly recessed, flush 

system painted to match the siding, so that it blends in and 

doesn't stand out too much in the façade.    

          Next slide?  This is a closer up view of that.  So 

you kind of get a sense of rendering for rendering and what 

the scale and coloration of those are.  The only other 

change here is we took the glass out of the front doors.  It 

was hard to find a durable fiberglass door, and tolls 

operations staff also thought it was a little less secure, 

and there's a window right next to the door anyway, so that 

we took the windows out of the doors in this view, for the 

walkup units.   

          Next slide, please?   

          And this is showing similar detail in the artisan 

siding in Building A, how the vents will work in that.   

          Next slide, Swaathi?   

          Then on the north open space design, there were a 

few comments, and a lot happened here.  You may be aware the

neighbors petitioned Westbrook to move trees out of the 

courtyard of the old office building.  So they all got 

translated down into the wetland area here, where the 

potential play space was.   

          The Conservation Commission didn't want anybody 

going down into the wetlands, so that developed into this 

natural area.  And then as part of the tree settlement, 

there's a granite wall that runs along the railroad spur, 

and they wanted us to leave as many of the mature trees that 

were there on the top of the granite wall.   

          So that became part of that tree settlement, and 

it sort of prevented this art walk that was kind of in the 

same location from being put in on the project.  And the 

landscape architects developed this kind of boardwalk, which 

allows you to overlook the wetlands area, but not go down 

into it. 

          And there are some swings on some steel armchair 

there.  There was a comment that this had transitioned to 

permeable asphalt over the permeable pavers, and the comment 

they wanted to go back to the permeable pavers, so we've 

adjusted that here, and put the permeable pavers back in the 

parking lot, because its maybe used not always for parking; 

122

that was one of the things is that we would study this over 

time and see if it was needed. 

          And then the mound -- the sort of football-shaped 

space there is a mound that has a path cut through it.  And 

that's done in AstroTurf, because it wouldn't be really 

maintainable as real grass.  And the comment was to look at 

putting natural grass there, which sort of won't hold up.   

          And since then, we've seen a park at MIT and some 

stuff at Lesley that they've used the Astroturf, and it 

actually looks pretty good and will hold up well.  So we are 

asking if we can use that to keep that device in the plan. 

          Next slide, Swaathi? 

          Similarly, at the private outdoor spaces for the 

unit, the stoop units that are all along above the parking 

garage here for similar reasons, we are using Astroturf in 

those private spaces which are behind a wood fence.  And so, 

all of the green here would be the Astroturf again for 

maintenance and for the aesthetics, that it'll look good for 

a good while.   

          And then next slide? 

          And then inside the courtyard there's another 

three private outdoor spaces, and this is kind of behind the

berm that's in the large courtyard there.  And I think that 

hits all of the issues, I don't know.  Erik, did I miss 

anything?     

          Oh, excuse me, one more.  So in the red dots at 

the top of the slide you'll see the transformers as they 

were originally proposed, which they were landscaped.  As we 

worked with Endstar/Eversource, they wanted a bigger 

substation here.  So you see in the lower left that that 

grew quite a bit.   

          And we're proposing to use the ground face block 

like we did the garage at Fuse, because that comes right out 

to where the fire truck access is that goes along the back 

there.  So that -- it meets their qualifications in terms of 

protecting the transformers, and it aesthetically worked 

very well at Fuse.  So I think that's the last issue.  I'm 

sorry I missed that one. 

          Is there another?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          ED HODGES:  Oh.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh.   

          ED HODGES:  There's another one.  So this is 

Lesley University.  This is Astroturf in a street turned

pedestrian walkway.  This shows you how that looks, as an 

example. 

          And this is an example from around town.  Some of 

the flush venting in the lower left there, you see the vents 

are painted to match the brick and match the kind of copper 

bronze color, which is so ours will be painted to match, so 

they're flush in the façade.  And we heard the kind of 

projecting vents that are on Atmark are not favored, so 

we've avoided those in the building. 

          And I think that sums it up now.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Let's see.  Do the 

Planning Board members have any questions?  I do have one 

question.  I note that in the open space in the back, that 

area that is the AstroTurf, could you explain what that is 

again?  It didn't make any sense to me.  That little area.  

          ED HODGES:  So this is a mound.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Uh-huh.   

          ED HODGES:  So it's like half a football, so it's 

raised up, and then it has some Corten steel sides on it, 

where the path cuts through it so it has a shape to it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  And what is the point of it? 

          ED HODGES:  It's just a land form that gives some

interest to the plaza, you know, in terms of that 

everything's not just flat.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Uh-huh, okay.   

          EVAN STAPLES:  There are also -- excuse me, Evan 

Staples --        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.   

          EVAN STAPLES:  -- benches placed, you know, along 

some of these lines, as you can see them in the rendering 

there placed about for folks to sit.  It's kind of just a 3D 

feature to help, you know, people can sit on it and read a 

book or, you know, relax and just have a little bit of a 

juxtaposition to the hardscape around that boardwalk area.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Got it, okay.  Did you also say there 

were swings in there?   

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yeah.  So if you see some of those 

kind of diagonal lines --        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.   

EVAN STAPLES:  -- crossing the boardwalk area, those are 

steel posts and beams that they are intended to have some 

swings hang off of them.   

          So again, someone could sit, they could sit with a 

friend in a couple of swings and have a conversation, enjoy 

126

kind of the -- I know you mentioned the nice thought of a 

meadow on the last presentation; that down in that 

floodplain area is going to be a wild meadow mix.  So kind 

of more of a peaceful area down in this north park, and then 

below the granite wall. 

          So I'm just trying to facilitate some relaxation.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, so and is this -- is the 

area to the upper left of the boardwalk, is that area that 

people could go sit on? 

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yeah.   

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yes.  Every --  

          ED HODGES:  That's open lawn.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  I just wanted to be 

sure.  Okay.  So my fellow Board members, other questions 

from anybody?  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Perhaps I missed it, but there 

seemed to be many fewer trees on this plan on the left-hand 

side, and why is that? 

          EVAN STAPLES:  I don't know if I can answer that 

exactly.   I know a lot of the trees moved into the wetlands 

were the ones that the neighbors negotiated came out of the 

courtyard of the existing building.

          So great expense was taken to move those trees 

down there, whereas the drawing on the left at the time of 

the special permit was a conceptual thing that was going to 

be developed, you know, as we moved along with the DPW and 

the Conversation Commission. 

          And I was not in those negotiations, so I don't 

know exactly how that ended up.  But we could find out.   

          ED HODGES:  Yeah, my understanding was that it was 

a mix of utility coordination and overall tree study for the 

property; some of the trees got moved into the -- some of 

them you can see down in the right-hand corner, there are 

more trees.  They got moved into some of these peripheral 

spaces and less on the street edge.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.  Yeah, I mean, overall it does 

look like fewer trees though.  So Lou, you had your hand up, 

I think.  Did I see you with your hand up?  Yeah.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I understand my first 

question, it appears that the brick has changed in the 

building on the left in the elevations.  Is that true, a 

different color brick and a stone base of some sort?     

          ED HODGES:  There is a stone base.  I think if 

you're looking at -- the brick is the same --

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Same one.     

          ED HODGES:  -- we showed you.  It could just, the 

color and the renderings has evolved over time, but it's the 

same brick that was in the material boards that we showed 

you originally.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay.  Second, has anything 

happened to the entrance courtyard?  There seems to be a big 

change there.  It's clear in the second rendering, but I'm 

not sure what happened.     

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yeah, I can speak to that.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It's on page 10.  

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yeah, Evan Staples, Toll Brothers.  

There was a -- just a shift of the walkway entering into the 

entrance courtyard.  If you're talking about entrance 

courtyard being between the two kind of C- shaped buildings 

B and C, or are you speaking -- yeah, right there?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Between B and C. It appears 

that there's now a wall, or maybe there was a wall and it 

was faded out in the original drawing?     

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yeah, so if you're speaking about 

on the right-hand side closest to Building C, there always 

was a berm there, an earthen mound that's engineered soil 

129

over on deck.  But then there are benches built into that 

mound that have always been part of the conceptual design.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay, and my final question 

-- my other question is, why is there no screening on the 

mechanicals on the roof?  And it seems like we've added a 

lot of mechanicals.     

          EVAN STAPLES:  We do have a parapet, but it's not 

overly tall; I think just from the height of the building, 

but maybe Ed, I don't know if you could speak to that?  

There aren't too many units that are overly tall.  Probably 

the highest projecting items are the stair towers, which 

might appear to be more mechanical in nature from a 

distance.   

Swaathi?   

          If you can -- yeah, look at the elevation there, 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I'm still on page 10.     

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yep.     

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yeah, I mean this is really 

coordination, I would imagine, where the mechanicals weren’t 

realized at the time of the conceptual design.  Ed, I don't 

know if you can speak a little more to that?       

          ED HODGES:  I think at the time of the design this

is mostly small condensers in the middle of the roof, and I 

don't know, I see what you're looking at Lou, is the two 

bigger green units?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Also, clarified all of the 

other units on the roof.     

          ED HODGES:  So I know we discussed that there was 

mostly the small condensers in the middle of the roof, and 

then the outer part of it was available for solar.  But I 

see those are -- look like they're much larger units.  So we 

should look at that.       

members?  Ted?     

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Any other questions from Board 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Tell, I just want to follow up 

on Lou's comment, which is what we see all the time of 

initial plans that show a nice, flat, uncluttered roof, and 

then the final plans end up with tremendous amount of 

mechanicals and being told, "Well, you know, it was 

originally conceptual and it's only after the engineers got 

involved that we had to have this and we had to have that."  

          And I think that's just totally unacceptable, and 

that there has to be some design for some screen or 

something else to screen the mechanicals.  It's just not,

"Oh, they appeared suddenly."    

          ED HODGES:  Understood.  We will definitely study 

that.  I'll make sure that -- first of all, that the scale 

is correct for the units that are being shown in this 

elevation, and then we'll focus on a design in order to 

screen them appropriately.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I assume Erik is still on?         

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Erik, you know that's an 

ongoing concern of mine?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yes.  Thanks for pointing that 

out.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Erik, do you want to give us your 

thoughts on some of these suggested changes?  I mean, 

obviously if you brought it to the Board, you thought it was 

reason we needed to look at your concern.  And since there 

isn't a memo detailing those concerns, you could just tell 

us your thoughts, that would be helpful.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  We looked at several of 

these things and thought probably okay in the big picture.  

The change from metal panels to the EI, or to the fiber 

cement panels in the spandrels and at the penthouse, they're 

132

22

using a heavier fiber cement panel that is typical and 

avoiding joints in the spandrels, so that it should look 

more or less the same as simply a flat surface; it's not the 

thin, sort of worked cement panel you see on a lot of 

projects. 

          The columns on the bottom two floors originally 

concrete, then were labeled stucco.  And it seems, although 

we generally try to stay away from stucco in a fairly small 

area like this, it probably is okay and is more resistant to 

water where it goes down to the ground and provides 

insulation that they're looking for. 

          Let's see.  The -- what's the next thing?  Oh, the 

vents.  Also, we generally discourage through all vents and 

the exterior façade -- these look, at least in the 

renderings, surprisingly good because of the corrugated, you 

know, the vertically striated, corrugated material.   

          It seems to actually kind of blend in and serve 

more as a sort of dot on the façade that adds a little bit 

of detail.  It doesn't look like the intrusive, you know, 

big -- kind of interruption that you see on some buildings.   

          And they've gathered together more than one vent 

behind a single color, so that all of those rectangles are 

133

22

the same as each other and arranged in a consistent pattern, 

according to the drawings.  So that all seems good. 

          We understand there are changes to the park at the 

north, due to agreements made with Conservation Commission, 

and that -- you know, we accept that that's happening.  Did 

wonder about the spacing of the street trees that I think 

Ted pointed out, and the design of that little plaza there 

itself.    

          We can probably, you know, take a look at that -- 

continuing review or something like that would fit in with 

what you think.  Not quite sure about the swings and the 

little mound and so on.  So it seems like something that can 

be resolved, though, as the project goes. 

          Let's see.  Other --      

          MARY FLYNN:  What about the balconies?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Oh, yeah.  The balconies -- 

actually that seems kind of a good change.  I've had similar 

concerns about glass just not looking too wonderful unless 

it's really well kept up like you would have in a corporate 

building.  And there is some concern about horizon bars on 

railings as a sort of climbing hazard when verticals don't 

present that.  So that seems okay.

21

22

          And I actually sort of like the amount of detail 

that a metal railing gives you.  It adds a little bit of -- 

you know, close to hand craftsmanship in -- kind of as 

detail in the façade. 

          So it seems okay.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  So my concern about that was 

just that before there was a variety of balcony types, you 

know, which kind of lent interest.  I understand the 

maintenance issues with the glass and the safety issues.   

          But somewhat, you know, even though the balcony 

may be more attractive, I'm just concerned that having the 

same balcony type across the entire -- because it's a big 

building, you know -- that it actually, I mean I think it's 

going to be less interesting from my perspective. 

          But again, you know, I'm not trained the way that 

you guys -- that was my initial take on it, so I -- you 

know, we'll see how other Board members feel.   

          Lou, you had a question?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I don't know if Erik 

wants to -- the balconies, are they actually truly a 

suspended balcony? It looks like you had a problem with 

having a constructability problem, and they also look like

they're larger.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Well there, because of all the 

insulation, you know, essentially from energy codes but on 

the outside of the building the best way to structure this 

was to have a prefab building that comes and is bolted onto 

the building, versus trying to cantilever out the wood 

structure.   

          So the bottom of it's bolted in, and then the top 

of it is on hangers that goes in through the structure.  And 

so, you have less going through the insulation.  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Hm.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  And I think they're the same 

size.  Some of them are half in, half out of the façade.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And just comparing the 

elevations here, they just look larger.     

          EVAN STAPLES:  Yeah, well, Madam Chair we have 

these -- these balconies are semi-recessed and articulated 

within the façade to give a little bit more interest to the 

balcony areas themselves and create these bands in the 

building that are helping to create kind of a more dramatic 

effect.   

          They still have kind of a special moment in these 

136

areas where the siding and the wrap into the building 

creates a unique surface and also shadow lines that help 

give some dynamic nature to the façade of the building.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you for that explanation.  So 

one other thought:  Erik, did you have anything else you 

wanted to add?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  No, I think that's it.  Those 

were the main points that we --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  -- talked about when we 

reviewed it with the applicant.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Hugh, what are your thoughts?         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think the -- everything's fine, 

except for the point that Lou brought up about the 

mechanicals being exposed, and the applicant is going to 

study further. 

          This is actually a more detailed building than 

most of the residential buildings.  It's more interesting, 

and the level of quality is basically higher.   The changes 

really don't change the level of quality; they do some 

things a little differently.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  But it's still, you know, head and 

shoulders above the typical apartment buildings that we're 

seeing built in the city.  So I mean I'm -- I guess I'm a 

huge fan of Ed Hodges' work, because I think he's really, 

you know, the most skilled architect working in the city on 

these kinds of buildings.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, thank you for that.  I 

appreciate your expertise.  My untrained eye is thinking 

back to Niko's comments before it.  I mean, my thought was 

that it just seemed as though it was getting blander, rather 

than more interesting.   

          And, you know, the AstroTurf -- I don't know, to 

me I hate the idea of AstroTurf.  I mean, I understand again 

it's a maintenance issue, but I almost would prefer that we 

just look at, like a completely different solution, you 

know?  Whether it be plantings or something else.   

          To me, it just -- I don't know, it just is not 

appealing.  And that is, I guess, more of a personal 

preference.  If the architects think that it can look nice 

and be maintained and give off the same or better sense than 

grass or bushes, then I'm with it.  But, again, I was just -

- the details just struck me as less appealing than what we 

138

had before.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  If I could comment?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  The AstroTurf is being used almost 

exclusively in private patio areas.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So basically, the only person who's 

going the see it is the person who lives in the apartments.  

The photograph of the material shows that it's really a 

pretty good job.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  But the idea of trying to get a 

maintenance guy to come in there with a lawnmower and a 

weedwhacker into all of these privacy spaces, moving the 

kids' toys around, whatever:  Is just not, it's a big, big 

problem.  And if you don't really see it. 

          As far as the mound, the buried football mound --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Meh, I know, I think you have to 

rely upon them to make the proper material selection for 

something like that.  You know, there's a lot of changes out 

there, but I think it's going to be as appealing as it was

before, it's just different.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Well, again, I 

thank you for your expertise.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  While we were on the 

AstroTurf, will this be permeable?  How is this going to be 

installed?  Does this change your permeable paving?  Does 

this change any of your numbers?       

          ED HODGES:  No.  Because it's on top of the 

garage.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That's what I was curious 

about.  I didn't know where it was going to be mounted, it's 

on the garage.  No drainage at all?     

          ED HODGES:  Right.  Well, the garage slab is down 

slightly from the finished grade elevation, so that it 

drains off.  But in terms of the permeable area, it's on top 

of the garage; it's only really used on areas on top of the 

garage, except for the football.  So it's not any different.     

          EVAN STAPLES:  I will say we're not married to the 

football idea, so we can -- we'll study that as well to make 

the best decision possible.     

          MIKE SAMPSON:  Yeah, thank you.  That would be 

helpful too.  So my fellow Board members, let me just say

there are still some members of the public who are on the 

Zoom meeting.  Is the Board open to taking public comment on 

this?  This is not a public hearing.   

          Okay.  I see one thumbs up.  I'm not seeing any 

thumbs down, so -- okay, so there aren't that many people on 

the line anyway, so it shouldn't take too long, but -- so 

let us do public comment. 

          Any members of the public who wish to speak should 

now click the icon at the bottom that says, "Raise hand."  

If you're calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by 

pressing *9.  As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, we received no 

written communications on this case.   

          So let me see.  Okay.  At the moment, we have one 

person who wants to speak; I know there may be more before 

we end.  So now we'll ask Jeff to unmute the speaker.  

Speakers should begin by saying your name and address, and 

Staff will confirm that we can hear you.  After that, you'll 

have up to three minutes to speak before I ask you to wrap 

up.   

Jeff, I'll turn it over to you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  The one person -- 

and I apologize if I mispronounce your name, but you can

give your name yourself and your address:  Is Michael 

Ledoux.  You can unmute yourself and begin your comments 

with your name and address.   

          MICHAEL LEDOUXZ:  Yeah, thanks.  You got it 

perfectly.  Michael Ledoux, 31 Wheeler Street.  I have the 

luxury of overlooking the excavation behind me here from 31 

Wheeler Street on the third floor, and we definitely feel 

the vibrations just of the trucks.  So I'm not looking 

forward to any pile driving in the future, but apart from 

that… 

          When I looked at the first drawing that you had up 

there, to the point some of the members were making that, 

you know, all of a sudden, they see all the HVAC stuff on 

the roof, and to the other point was the trees in that 

second rendition in October, 2020.   

          In that rendition, I don't see any trees around 

the property, even.  You know, and it's such a dry space out 

here, it's kind of like a concrete desert.  And we really 

need tree support out here. 

          The other thing -- so I hope that there's a -- 

that you evaluate what's going on with the tree situation. 

          The other point is drainage.  You know, we have --

at 31, at Wheeler Street here, reservoir loss.  When this 

building was first made, they started having flooding 

problems in our parking basement below, and I imagine you 

guys might be susceptible to that as well if you don't have 

a good drainage system in place. 

          And, you know, I'm not sure about artificial turf, 

or as you guys call it:  AstroTurf.  But, you know, if 

that's going to impede proper drainage.   

          But I would say you might want to reevaluate a lot 

of your drainage considerations, or we might have a lot of 

flooding in this area.  And that's about it.  I just -- it's 

more on the landscaping side of things and drainage are my 

concerns.  But thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  That is the only 

speaker.  So I'll just give one final call.  If anyone is 

still on the line and hasn't spoken yet, would like to 

speak, please push the, "Raise hand" button or *9 on your 

phone.       

          Not seeing any, so I'll turn it back over.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  So perhaps 

you should just quickly address the drainage issue.  I'm 

assuming that, you know, the changes you've made in the

wetlands area are to protect that area, and that it does 

have some flood retention.  But I also recall that you did 

have mitigation efforts within the project.  So has anything 

changed in that regard, either improved or lessened?     

          EVAN STAPLES:  So we have, obviously, abided by 

Concom's or Conservation Commission 's guidelines and input 

on, you know, how to treat the floodplain and maintain the 

floodplain over time, and why that is kind of an off-limits 

and more of a viewing area, and no development in our around 

that space. 

          The drainage within our property is maintained by 

under building drainage systems and has been engineered to 

handle the groundwater as we have seen tested in well points 

and over historical data.   

          So we are, you know, observing that daily as we're 

in excavation as well and making sure it's, you know, 

aligning with our assumptions.  So we're confident that our 

systems and our design are taking all those points into 

consideration. 

          Furthermore, on the landscaping portion of the 

comment, I think that's just a function of the rendering.  

The second rendering is an architectural rendering and

didn't have the landscaping layer included into it, so I 

apologize for that misrepresentation, but there are still 

trees around the property; the property line on the 

reservoir loss side, the left-hand side does have trees 

there.   

          It is a fairly tight dimension, and we do have a 

lot of infiltration taking place from, as we were 

discussing, the courtyard over the garage.  So we have 

infiltration basins surrounding the building, allowing for 

stormwater to regenerate back into the soil. 

          So all those things considered, we have to take 

those into account when designing our drainage systems.   

          And I will add -- I meant to mention at the top of 

our meeting that we are striving for a LEED goal 

certification on this project, so a lot of our design has 

been driven by that end goal.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Ari, thank you for that.  So 

now, are there final comments from the Board members?  Let's 

start with Lou.  Have you anything you want to add?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  No.  I think they've done a 

lot of good work.  I think we really need to look at this 

screening issue on the roof equipment.  But as far as that,

I think everything else is in pretty good standing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Steve?  What are 

your thoughts?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  No comments.  You know, I wonder 

about the AstroTurf, but I don't have feelings strong enough 

to impose upon the developers.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you.  Ted?  Final 

thoughts?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Not really, they have been 

stated.  I mean, I was concerned about all the vents, but 

Erik seems to think they're fine, and Hugh seems to think 

all the changes are fine.  So, you know, other than, you 

know, the trees and screening the mechanicals on the roof, I 

am okay.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And Hugh, you obviously gave 

us some great comments already.  Did you have anything else 

you wanted to add?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Just wanted to thank Toll Brothers 

for sponsoring the Metropolitan Opera broadcast for many 

years.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh!  Very nice.  There we go.  Adding 

to our cultural landscape, a long way other thing.     

146

          EVAN STAPLES:  You're very welcome.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Beautiful.  Okay, so then, are we 

prepared to conclude the Design Update by finding that the 

design remains in substantial conformance with the approved 

plan and the conditions of the special permit, subject to 

continuing Design Review by staff, with particular attention 

and additional study of the mechanical screening and the 

tree plan? 

          Is there a motion?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved.  Steve -- so moved.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis second.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Jeff, could we have a roll 

call vote, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  On the motion to conclude the 

Design Update, Lou Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  H Theodore Cohen?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steven Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.

          [All 5 vote YES]               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  So that's all the five 

members present voting in favor.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, thank you very much to 

the team for coming in and doing your presentation.  And we 

wish you well in moving forward with your project.     

          EVAN STAPLES:  Thank you very much for maintaining 

these meetings and for your time this evening.       

          MARY FLYNN:  You're welcome.  Okay.  So that 

concludes the business on our agenda.  Are there additional 

comments from Staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  There's nothing from me.  I don't 

hear anybody else jumping in --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So we're going to say no, and 

Board members, do you have any additional comments before we 

adjourn?  I'm thinking no.  Okay, so then therefore, the 

meeting is adjourned.  Thank you all.  It's good to see 

everybody.
