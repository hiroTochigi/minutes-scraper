and speaking from the cambridge president alliance waupee cambridge green new deal saying petition on so excited about this petition is so urgent to fight climate change and the way that this petition combined sat fight with the historical and economic justice is exciting to me and i think also to be really effective i think it's very elegantly designed the way that it creates a fee at the beginning of the life of a new commercial building and then direct that the funds coming from the fee to either support green jobs development programs or actual energy efficiency programs that benefit low income in minority communities in cambridge so it's very exciting as it's very nicely done i think it would lead to a lot of solar installations on roping efficiency of great tasting buildings and would lead to benefits for jobs and economic opportunity for people of colour in cambridge and like the previous perils very glad that it except residential so i think the council should hold a hearing as soon as possible on this and moved as quickly as possible forward so that discomposed our procedure in cambridge this year and no later than you
