i meredith's a good idea of that last one of the metis earlier this year of the neighboring term planning baboons are conciliation committee did convene all of the neighborhood groups we did use a list on the website and as if that time had noted that there were so few differences between the context that were listed in the ones that those groups and said that they were in charge of an we did ask at that time she beat up i believe the working on it and the council might now and then sarcostemma have seen this also sudden the process of re configured in a little bit some of their work with neighbourhead appointing people within the department to ensure that the neighborhood groups haricot basically within ceded so they can be acted them hopefully updated in the list will be something they can do to ensure that those outside the city do have the preception so i certainly think this is an appropriate task i also think that the cid is working on it and it might be good to get enough date which i will try to do it the next and eliciting will be calling one to follow up on the discussion that we had about the city working with neighborhood groups across the city well where it is a process of scheduling act and we will certainly let the council now look that those thus discussions
