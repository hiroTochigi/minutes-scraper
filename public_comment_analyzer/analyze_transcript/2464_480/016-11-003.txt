but all this work in putting it together and generally i support it and would welcome in but from the other counsellors thank you externall heather hoffman to thirteen early street first i'd like to talk about the housing to policy order i bonover interested to hear what the people writing the regulation thinkses i think that it's not all that well written it westholt to be imagination it is really going to need regulation i hope that you will especially now them down on what they mean by eligible location since that seemed to be really a crook of the whole idea of where you can have so initiates hand then i hope you will also find out if there's anything in there that actually requires it to get deserter we could discount emplace as long as we permit untimely housing there by right or by special permit a second thing i want to talk about is a resolution and that's the one on telling our consulate should live their lives this transit are very close to my heart and i do not want to see us do something that makes lives of trans people somewhere else more difficult one of the things that i do because leaped to do probating is a do the legal work for changing trans people's names and so when i saw this i thought if i were sitting in governor hutchinson's office and i got this resolution i would think that it was a bunch of liberal came who think that they know a lot more about our lives than we do sitting on their high horses telling us what to do there is not a single mention of local organizations in there not a single mention of carrying about your friends and neighbors short children not as that it just sounds like us telling them that there bunch of of ignorant hillbilly and they should know better and were smart astarte are it's not a good way to influence people to convince people to come around to your way of thinking and i think that this concealment too much time this term on his high horse and was too little time thinking about how to convince people thank you
