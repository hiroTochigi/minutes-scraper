through the mayor this is jeff roberts director owning a development filling in on this one so our plan for the ordnance committee hearing we will be bringing the planning word recommendation petition as it stands is the is the person that was discussed by the economic development committee i think was back in september and certainly it is generally from my preference because those that hearing process works have been parallel for these owning positions we have started to look at the comments that were made by the planning board and usually belike to incorporate and additional comments manmade by the ordnance committee and then prepare any final versions of the zoning toubac efore the city council for action so certainly we can i think the planning or some of the plain of worcester sort of general in nature and i would certainly be interested in hearing what members of the council think about those points and if there are additional comments or direction provided by the ordnance committee we would work to put those together with the plant for common work with the low apartment and inspection services as necessary to put all those changes in and and provide them back to the city house one thing i would mention him i'm sure nancy could could fill in on missus well is that any changes on this point would have to remain within the the scope of the original petition but certainly it's possible that if the council did want to go go to proceed to make additional changes that were in the scope of this isolation we can work with a lot of parmentier a follow up that would solve any of those outstanding issues and this is a pretty visit of pretty not to educate changed to the the war uses her define listed and treated in the onions is certainly not not unusual to try it to take softhearted any additional issues immediately or as issues arise over time
