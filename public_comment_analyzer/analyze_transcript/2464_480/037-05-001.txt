and and i understand it would not be a poor man responded sawanec you to this announced waving all festering thing understand that i just wanted to make sure we did do everything we could my understanding is that as you indicated we wait forty per cent of some test where again the son everope cities were waving a hundred per cent of some feet i would like us to be way ahead of others and not just the license fees but other fees as well whether subserves or lighter you know as we talked about was in measures or whether it's operating fee for hairpins everything we possibly can do to help our small businesses and to continue to work with the small business associations but also the notices that may not be part of an association across the city because we have a number of areas in the city that don't have the benefit of that association so we stand behind you do everything you can and i hope it's more than we done to day and that we can really even even for this current year thank you
