          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  First Planning Board 

meeting of 2020.  I was reminded this week that I need to 

advise people who are present that the meeting is being both 

audio and video recorded, and other than that, I think I'd 

turn it over to CDD for an update.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thanks, 

and it's good to see the Board again, and to get kicking off 

for the new year.   

          The -- just quickly on the updates, it's the start 

of a new City Council term, so things are still sort of 

shaping up, and there's normally a lot of updates about 

meetings that are taking place, and meetings that have 

occurred, and those are really just starting to get going. 

          So just focusing on the Planning Board schedule, 

tonight is hopefully a fairly light agenda, with one of the

perennial favorite Planning Board cases -- a special permit 

for conversion of a nonresidential structure to residential 

use.  And then just an order of general business, a timing 

extension, and then there will be the annual election of the 

Planning Board Chair. 

          Next week, January 21, there will be two public 

hearings, both on cannabis retail establishments.  One is a 

new proposal for 966 Cambridge Street.   

          Another is a continuation of the proposal at 541 

Mass Ave, which is the colocation of a cannabis adult use 

retail with a medical establishment, and there was a request 

for an opinion from the City Solicitor's office, so that 

will be provided. 

          The next meeting the following week, is on January 

28, and there will be public hearings.  The first is 40 

Thorndike Street, an address the Board has heard a lot about 

over the years.   

          This is -- and I think most Board members are 

probably familiar that after -- so the Board is seeing this 

again after five years -- maybe almost six years now, it was 

granted a project for the conversion of the courthouse 

building, it was granted a special permit.   

5

          It went through some amount of litigation, and 

then after that had to seek a disposition of parking spaces 

with a municipal garage.  That was approved by the Council 

last year, but along with that, the proponent agreed to some 

changes that have to in turn go back to the Planning Board 

for additional special permit.   

          So that will be reviewed on January 28, and after 

that, I guess time permitting, a design update on the 

Cambridge Crossing Parcels G and H. 

          And then finally, February 4 will be the annual 

town presentations and reports.  And those reps will be made 

available I hope in the near future.  So that's I think far 

enough ahead for now, and turn it back over.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thank you 

very much.  We have two transcripts ready for adoption this 

week; the December -- the minutes from December 10 and 

December 17, which have been certified as complete.  Do I 

have a motion for adoption of this?   All those in favor?  

          [ All 7 vote YES ]    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It's unanimous.  All 

right.

          Then we can move to our public hearing for evening 

on Planning Board #56 -- 56 Creighton Street.  Is someone 

here to speak on behalf of the proponent?       

          ROBERT LINN:  Hi, I'm Robert Linn.  I'm the 

architect with Moskow Linn Architects, and I'm here with 

Catherine Signal and Duncan MacArthur, who is the owner and 

developer of this project.        

          THE REPORTER:  Excuse me, sir.  Do you mind 

spelling your name?         

          ROBERT LINN:  Yep, Robert Linn, R-o-b-e-r-t L-i-n-

n.  So this project -- oh, okay, yeah.  Thank you.  This 

project is at the very end of Creighton Street, right along 

the MBTA line, and the current structure, which is shown 

right here, had been used as a commercial printing shop. 

          And it's sort of in a residential district, where 

everything on Creighton Street is much more residential in 

7

scale, like the drawings here.  But as you move along around 

the tracks, there's been other, repurposed warehouses that 

have been changed to the commercial, and that are more in 

keeping with the residential district.   

          And that's our proposal, which is to take this 

structure and work within the existing -- work within the 

existing volume of the structure, to create three 

residential units.  

          And so, we, of course, are using the 5.28, which 

is the zoning ordinance section that, as you guys know, 

allows us to convert something from a nonresidential use to 

a residential use, and because the city is hoping that 

people will repurpose and reuse existing buildings, there's 

an opportunity to increase the FAR beyond what's allowable 

in the district, and potentially decrease the open space, 

given the fact that it's already built out to all the lot 

lines. 

          And working with the Planning Board, we feel that 

we've presented something here that actually really will 

improve the neighborhood, improve this particular corner of 

Creighton Street, and is very much in keeping with the other 

buildings that have already been repurposed along the MBTA 

8

line. 

          So our proposal is to -- and in addition to just 

this building, the entire project encompasses 56R, which is 

this piece here, which is where we're repurposing some of 

this for open space, but also, we're putting our off-street 

parking in this area.   

          And it encompasses this little section here, which 

is held in ownership by Duncan and this grouping of parcels, 

but as an easement for parking for this particular 

structure. 

          So you'll see in our proposal that we're leaving 

this as is, but we're including is as part of our -- you 

know, all of our FAR calculations. 

          The concept is, well, as I said before, staying 

within the volume of the existing building, we wanted to 

create more opportunity for light, windows and privacy.  So 

we've carved away zones from the building that would create 

terrace spaces.   

          So the actual perimeter of the building now has 

this much more of a sawtooth kind of profile, which allows 

us to have these interior -- not really, these exterior 

terrace spaces, and gives us the opportunity for a second

means of egress. 

          On the two units, I'll get into the planning 

further, but two units are now going to be accessed directly 

off of Creighton Street.  We're going to keep the sidewalk.  

We're proposing to keep the sidewalk, as it's currently been 

built, which is flush with the street.   

          And currently all of this was just loading.  So 

we're going to keep the sidewalk, add green space to all of 

this area, which creates a buffer between what we see as the 

vehicular movement and the residential space, and we're 

going to keep the green space back here, which has the 

significant trees on the property.  And I'll talk more about 

those later.   

          But we're going to keep all of this green space, 

and potentially leave access for bike and walking path to 

get to what may be in the future a multipurpose corridor 

that happens along the MBTA line.  So all that will happen 

in this section over here. 

          Currently, as you'll see here, there's a kind of a 

barrier.  The street ends in a dead end, and something juts 

out into the end of the street.  And so, if you're going to 

access vehicular access to this property, you have to kind 

10

of cut through this little corner right here.   

          And then all of this essentially up to this point 

is paved, and just wide-open space. 

          So in our proposal we're actually extending 

Creighton Street all the way through.  And then even though 

we're only proposing three units, we're going to have six 

potential spaces here, because when we made some of our 

initial presentations to the community, one of the things 

they were very concerned about was if we were going to be 

adding additional units here, there would be potentially 

additional parking on Creighton Street.   

          And so, we wanted to provide the required three 

parking spaces, but also three potential guest spaces. 

          Another kind of component is that we are adding 

additional -- I guess I'll get to it later, but we're adding 

additional open space in the form of terraces on the third 

floor.   

          So currently we have I think a little over two -- 

there's a little over 2,000 square feet of what could be 

considered open space.  We're almost doubling that to 4,000 

square feet, by adding the additional green space, and the 

terrace is on the roof.

          So we're increasing the private open space.  We're 

still under the allowable, and so, we will need some special 

permit to have less than what's required, but we're 

increasing what's there. 

          The other thing that we're asking for some special 

permit permission for is that in order to really create this 

buffer zone that I was talking about here, with this green 

space, we wanted to push all of the parking right to the 

edge of this property line of this 56R section.  And the 

zoning bylaws require a five-foot buffer between parking 

typically and adjacent property line.   

          Our thinking here is that because this is an MBTA 

line, and because this is not someone's private residential 

area, that we actually would push the parking right to that 

property line, and get -- that would give us space for both 

maneuverability, the buffer zone, and an area over here 

where there could be snow piling and some, you know, 

maneuvering if there was a fire truck coming through here. 

          So getting a little bit deeper into the planning, 

as I said before, we've carved these spaces away, and we 

actually worked very closely with Judy and Tom, who I'm sure 

were going to come and speak, but they're the next-door

neighbors here, and they're going to be the most impacted  

this project.   

          So we've worked with them, we've had three 

meetings at their home, they've actually invited us to their 

house and been really hospitable.  

          And we've worked together with them to create what 

we feel is a good solution, where we're going to keep the 

wall, the existing wall, and just add glass blocks, so 

there's no privacy issue, that no one's going to be looking 

into their courtyard, their beautiful yard space in the 

back. 

          And then in this area, where we've carved out for 

this terrace, we're going to have -- continue a five-foot 

section of the existing brick wall, and then have a 20-foot 

tall, green slatted screen wall that will create the privacy 

that I think we've agreed with them will satisfy both sides. 

          As I mentioned before, the entry is going to be 

two units here.  The entry to this back unit is here, and 

then each one of these units has these little outdoor carved 

away spaces. 

          The units themselves are all going to be four-

bedroom units.  And the hope was that by not maximizing the 

13

potential for multiple units in here, we'd be minimizing the 

car traffic number one -- we wouldn't have more cars --  but 

number two,  we'd be creating units that would be really 

hospitable to larger Cambridge families, and even 

potentially with four bedrooms you could have, you know, not 

just a conventional family, you could have an in-law or just 

something beyond that. 

          So it's three units with four bedrooms apiece.  

And then each one of the units, as I mentioned before, 

because we were trying to increase the open space, has a 

really nice terrace on -- at the third level.   

          And the third level, some of it would be, you 

know, slatted, some of it would be wide opinion, but we're 

really thinking this is living and dining, this is where 

people would be spending their time in the nice weather. 

          This is the existing façade on Creighton Street.  

This is the existing façade facing the tracks, and this is 

the existing façade facing Tom and Judy's house.   

          So right now, you know, their back yard faces this 

big section of blank wall, which they really liked and 

wanted to preserve.  This is our proposal for the Creighton 

Street.  We brought what we think is a lot more life and

energy to the structure.   

          And the way -- one very key thing that I didn't 

mention -- the way that we're adding the additional square 

footage that we're asking for is we're changing the floor to 

floor he is. 

          So currently, there's just two very tall loft-like 

spaces with a single floor level in between.  We're going to 

lower the first floor and add -- we're going to add -- by 

lowering each of these floors, we're going to be able to add 

one additional floor within the existing volume of what's 

there, making these much more residential in scale.  So the 

first floor, I believe, is nine feet clear floor to ceiling, 

eight feet and eight feet. 

          And so, this is our first floor, which now brings 

the scale of the first-floor Creighton Street much more into 

the residential scale.  We'll be changing the windows and 

the skin of the building.   

          We're thinking that it's going to be a metal skin 

on the part that's facing the street.  But then wherever 

we're carving away, we're going to have a wood, so it's a 

softer, more human scale when you move into these sorts of 

interior spaces.

22

          This is the view along the tracks.  So this is one 

of the courtyard spaces at the third floor.  This is one of 

those carved-in spaces that allows light deeper into the 

middle of the building, in this particular case.  And then 

there's the carved in space back behind here, behind this 

party wall.  That's a little bit more hidden. 

          This is the view that's to the -- our neighbors, 

to the neighbors, Tom and Judy.  This is what I was talking 

about now.  It's that same section of wall, but we will have 

changed the façade to have glass block.  But there actually 

is another building right here that has the same kind of 

glass block treatment, and they don't feel that it's been a 

privacy issue. 

          And this is the 20-foot slatted wall that we were 

talking about on top of the five foot.  And this gets it up 

the -- the top of this gets to a point beyond their highest 

windows on the second floor, so they didn't feel like anyone 

would be looking start across.   

          And our hope is to have this be a green wall, so 

that we'd allow plantings to grow up.  And eventually, I 

think, you know, it will be a nice kind of amenity to what 

they have there now.

22

          And this is just the same façade if you take that 

screening away, to show what's going on in that terrace, and 

to show how that carved away space allows us to get light 

deeper into the building. 

          The view from Creighton Street coming -- if the 

track's back here, this is that slatted wall.  These are the 

new entries to these other pieces, and this is the view 

along the tracks, and this is the relationship of what we're 

proposing to one of the existing, repurposed buildings 

that's immediately adjacent.   

          This is that slot, this is along their driveway. 

This is a view from their back yard.  And this is sort of an 

idea of the materials and the palate that we're talking 

about.  So the metal skin would be some kind of a corrugated 

metal.   

          And then on the parts that are going to be the 

softer, more human scale, we're thinking that there will be 

some wood, some paneled wood pieces that are in the same 

language, you know, we'll work with, I'm sure, the staff, to 

figure out plantings and walkways, but this is sort of the 

palate that we're imagining -- lighting from the past to get 

from the car.

          We found out from Swaathi later that we'd be 

proposing that we would have permanent bike storage.  We 

didn't actually need it from a zoning point of view.  So 

we're still showing it in our plans.   

          But one of the other issues that was raised was 

that this connector, the city wanted us to have this be five 

feet instead of six feet, and we're trying to really wrap it 

around these significant trees that we're keeping.  And so, 

we may need to rethink whether we have the bike parking or 

not.  But at the moment, we're still showing that in our 

project. 

          Trash and recycling for this unit would be out 

here, and trash and recycling and enclosures would be out 

here in the front of this structure.  I think those are the 

highlights.  I can answer any additional questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do Board members have 

questions before we take public comment?  All right.  Then, 

we will go to public comment first.  We did have a signup 

sheet.  I will call from that first.   

          Come forward to the microphone, give and spell 

your name and then your address.  You'll have three minutes 

to speak, and then anyone who hasn't signed up, who would 

18

like to be heard on the matter will still have a chance 

after that. 

          So first on the list is Judy Hikes.       

          JUDY HIKES:  Good evening.        

          THE REPORTER:  Would you please spell your name?         

          JUDY HIKES:  J-u-d-y H-i-k-e-s.  We've been 

talking with both Duncan, and especially Robert and 

Catherine about the plans.  So we're really clear on the 

plans, and we've negotiated things with them, and they've 

made adjustments, and so we feel good about the plans.   

          What we're most concerned about, which I don't 

think this Board addresses, is the fact that people will be 

working on our property, because the property lines are -- 

it's the same line.  In other words, this building is right 

on our property line, and that's our driveway, that's where 

we park the car, we have plants. 

          So those are the concerns we have.  And I don't 

think that that is what this Board addresses.  Am I correct 

about that?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's right.         

          JUDY HIKES:  So I just want to say that so far, 

we've been, you know, pleased with the plans, and that’s the

way we feel about it.    

Thomas Daly?       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  

          THOMAS DALY:  Yes.  Yes, my name is Tom Daly.  I 

live at 52 Creighton Street, and -- can you hear me?        

          THE REPORTER:  Yes.  Could you please spell your 

last name?         

          THOMAS DALY:  D-a-l-y.  And I'm hard of hearing, 

so Judy's my wife, and I just heard her speak about a 

concern about the plants and so forth.  And at this point 

we've had meetings, and it's gone well.  We have the latest 

plan, and Judy and I seem pretty comfortable at this point.  

          There's a few things that we need to iron out 

about working on our property and so forth, but that can be 

down the road with Duncan.  So at this point, I just concur 

with my wife.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Marilee 

Meyer?   

          MARILEE MEYER:  Hi, Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street 

-- M-a-r-i-l-e-e Meyer, M-e-y-e-r.  I actually wasn't 

planning on speaking, because I'm not as familiar with this 

project, but it does interest me.  I know the printing 

20

company, and used to go down there for projects.  Just a 

couple of things, if there's a change of use from commercial 

to residential, does that trigger zoning back to traditional 

setbacks or does the -- is the dimension grandfathered?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So that's why they're 

seeking the special permit.  There's a special permit --  

          MARILEE MEYER:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- available for that 

change, that would allow them to keep the existing 

structure, even though they're converting.   

          MARILEE MEYER:  Okay.  On the footprint.  And I do 

appreciate the shortened ceilings, and I wish more projects 

would look at that, so they don't have to do their 15, 20 

percent -- you know, whatever, cathedral ceilings and 

everything, which to me is a waste of space, but I think 

that's a good idea. 

          And also, there -- in one of the plans, there was 

a comparison with an adjoining building.  It was modern, 

dark green with clapboards and windows.  And, but that's no 

near -- is that just on the back side, on Walden Street?        

          ROBERT LINN:  It's on Regent, yep.   

          MARILEE MEYER:  This?

          ROBERT LINN:  Yep.  It's right here.  That's the 

edge of it.   

          MARILEE MEYER:  Ah, okay.  The        

          ROBERT LINN:  The edge of it is right here, and 

that's the building.   

          MARILEE MEYER:  All right.  Well, why I bring up 

these adjacent buildings, that -- oh, yeah, sorry -- is that 

the materials and the design have more of a traditional 

vocabulary to them, where they have -- you know, the 

horizontal clapboarding and the materials, and even -- you 

know, a slightly peaked roof, all those kinds of things.     

          Well, this project is better than most, but it's 

still square and big.  When you look at the short streets 

that are all peaked, smaller houses, you know contextually, 

it could be worse.   

          But I do have an issue with square buildings all 

the time, even --  I know what you're going to say, because 

that's a square building,  I know.   

          But you know, if you're going to revert it to 

residential, can the context be a little bit closer to -- I 

told you I wasn't prepared to talk.  But do you get -- you 

get my drift, right?  All right, thank you.

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

MARILEE MEYER:  -- square -- what happened to the 

peaked roofs around here?   

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So just 

so we're clear, a number of people did not check off whether 

they wanted to speak or not, so I will in that case call 

your name, and if you don't want to speak, it's okay to say 

so. 

The next page on the list is Julio Torres Santana.    

JULIO TORRES SANTANA:  Yeah.  Like Marilee, I 

wasn't planning to talk.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  You don't have to. 

JULIO TORRES SANTANA:  It's just a question, and 

it's a very simple one.  Julio Torres Santana, that's J-u-l-

i-o, T-o-r-r-e-s, and Santana, like the guitar player.  I

love saying that.   

So my question is coming from a point of view of 

an architect.  I'm an architect as well.  I see in your 

project the solar panels, if I'm recognizing those 

correctly, are visible in the façade.   

Is there a way to kind of -- I know sometimes when 

you try to hide and you block them from the sun, is there a

way that you could probably --?   

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sir, you should be 

addressing your question to the Board.

JULIO TORRES SANTANA:  Oh, sure.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  You can make a 

comment that you would like to see them better changed so 

that they address that concern.

JULIO TORRES SANTANA:  Yeah.  I was just wondering 

if there's a way to -- you know, from the street view, as 

you pass by, they're not as prominent in the project.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All 

right.  And then our last person who signed up is Mitzi 

Fennel. 

MITZI FENNEL:  I signed in, I wasn't planning to 

speak, but my husband thought I signed in for him, which I 

did, it looks like he would like to speak with you.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  

DOUG JEFFERS:  My name is Doug Jeffers, J-e-f-f-e-

r-s, and I live at 37 Creighton Street.  I have several

questions.  One is the façade with the metal siding.   

From the samples that they presented, I get the 

sense that they're looking for a modern look, but not an and

industrial look.  And that would be a concern, to stay with 

the residential character, not to have it look too 

industrial.               

          Also, the elevation showed the mechanicals being 

rooftop units, and I'd be concerned about the noise that 

they might create.   

          And I'm assuming that, you know, there's decibel 

ratings of these units that could be checked, just to make 

sure that there's not -- there's going to have at least 

three units up there, and I know just from experience with 

the neighbor adding a split-unit on the side of their house, 

that noise is significant.  So three big units on top of a 

building may also be a problem. 

          The space that -- there's a right of way for 

parking for the adjacent building, currently is blocked off 

using Jersey barriers.  But it does allow for pedestrian 

access.   

          And also, when her there are street closings or 

other issues, they'd open that for traffic to go through.  

And I'm wondering if that's going to be maintained.  

Certainly, a pedestrian access, but also the ability for 

perhaps emergency vehicles or, in the case of a street

closure for people to get from Regent to Creighton and vice 

versa.  Okay?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          DOUG JEFFERS:  And the front of the building, the 

sidewalk is being extended, and I assume a traditional curve 

put in.  And I trust that that's going to add additional 

public parking spaces to Creighton Street on the front 

elevation.  And those were my questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Thank you very much.  So that's everyone who signed in.  Are 

there others who would like to be heard on this matter?         

          THOMAS DALY:  Can I make an additional comment?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure.  Please come up 

to the mic.  You happened to catch us on a night where we're 

super light, which is definitely unusual.         

          THOMAS DALY:  I'll be very brief.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.         

          THOMAS DALY:  No, just -- now Doug had mentioned 

that there was a mechanical on the roof.  If you look at on 

Regent Street, the property besides the railroad, on the 

railroad track, there's an alley behind our house, which is 

52.

22

          That's behind the condos on the railroad side.  

And that is kind of like an amphitheater for sound -- even 

our neighbors have mentioned to us they can hear us talking.  

It's just -- so there may be a bit of a sound issue with the 

mechanical on the roof and the adjacent neighbor, where 

their alleyway is kind of like a sound amphitheater, all 

right? That's it, thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, okay.  So 

why don't we start with having you address a couple of those 

questions about the location of the solar panels, the metal 

siding potentially looking industrial rather than 

residential, and any of the sound issues with mechanicals 

that you can address?         

          ROBERT LINN:  So the idea with the solar panels 

was not necessarily to hide them.  I don't necessarily agree 

that seeing solar panels are negative.  I think something 

about that signals that the building is really striving to 

be very sustainable.  And this one will be.   

          We'll be insulating it to a degree that will make 

it very efficient -- one way it's being heated and cooled, 

we'll be using European windows that are tripled glazed, 

double or triple glazed, probably triple. 

27

          And the whole project will be probably one of the 

most energy efficient buildings in the neighborhood when 

we're done.  So seeing the solar panels potentially signals 

that in some way that we think is a positive.      

          In terms of the mechanicals, they will be 

relatively small, and there we position them right in the 

center, and we would definitely have some kind of a 

screening.   

          My sense is that they're going to be relatively 

quiet, and whatever noise that they may be making will be 

mitigated with the screening in our minds.  I don't think 

they'll be visible in any way from the street.  And, you 

know, there will be certainly no more noise from these than 

any mechanical systems for a typical residential structure.         

          THOMAS DALY:  In fact, they are going to be very 

high -- it's very quiet.   

units, yep.    

          ROBERT LINN:  Yeah, very -- they'll be very quiet 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  And then do you want 

to talk about the --        

          ROBERT LINN:  The skin?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- cladding, yep.

          ROBERT LINN:  So our thinking with the cladding 

was that this building, given the scale and the way that we 

are articulating it, it doesn't want to try to just pretend 

that it's a -- you know, a single-family or a two-family.  

It's something different.   

          And so, I think being kind of honest in the way 

that we're articulating it, we don't want it to be like a 

residential structure, but we wanted to sort of have 

elements that feel that they're residential in scale and 

massing.   

          So part of what we're thinking about with these 

panels is that there would be some corrugation so that you 

have shadow lines and you have texture that picks up on a 

lot of the same scale as clapboard or shingling.   

          And then we're also -- by breaking it down into 

these smaller components, we're using some of the same bay 

dimensions and some of these more residential dimensions 

that break the scale down.   

          So it's not necessarily trying to be a residential 

copycat, but it's trying to take cues from the residential 

structures and apply them to something that's really a very 

different, it's a repurposed industrial building.

          So I think we're going to be good neighbors, but 

we're not going to be trying to replicate residential 

detailing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  And then the 

last thing while I have you up there that was brought up was 

plans for the operation at the end of the street, how that 

changes.  Have you had any talks with Traffic and Parking or 

DPW about that yet?        

          ROBERT LINN:  I don't know if you've spoken to 

them directly about that, but our sense is that I've never 

heard of the Jersey barriers being moved.  That was the 

first time I'd ever understood that.  In all of our 

discussions, everyone that we've talked to has said those 

Jersey barriers are typically always there.  

          And in our minds, we were imagining that we would 

have some kind of a barrier -- not the Jersey barriers, 

necessarily, but there would be some sort of a barrier, 

whether it's a low fence or whether it's planting, or 

something to demarcate this line between the two.  But we 

never were imagining that this could ever be opened up for 

vehicular traffic to run through. 

          DUNCAN MACARTHUR:  But yeah, my understanding,

actually the barriers were --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sir.         

          DUNCAN MACARTHUR:  Sorry.          

          ROBERT LINN:  If you want to talk about the 

barriers, being there, because this is --  

          DUNCAN MACARTHUR:  It's not in my driveway.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  What --  

          ROBERT LINN:  In fact, Duncan was just saying was 

-- our understanding was the city actually didn't want 

traffic to be going through here, but they actually wanted 

to create a dead-end street situation.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.         

          ROBERT LINN:  So, you know, our idea is that there 

would be some access for pedestrians, but it would not be a 

vehicular access in any way.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Board members, questions?  Further?  Yeah, Steve.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Just 1 question, the sidewalk in 

front of the house, you're keeping the existing grade, which 

is flush, I gather vaguely with the pavement.         

          ROBERT LINN:  Correct.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  First of all, I presume there

will be parking there in front of the house, but there will 

be parking without any curb, is that correct?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  You know, that's something, 

whether there's parking or not is something the DPW would 

need to weigh in on.  Our idea was just to keep it as built, 

you know, not trying to change it from anything that's 

there, other than greening the space that would be on our 

property, where we would be creating that buffer.   

          So I don't know whether or not there would 

actually be parking spaces on that street or not.  Could be.  

It certainly would be open.  But it's not something that 

we've had a discussion with DPW about.  Because we're not 

changing what's there currently. 

          So I think it's to be determined.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I imagine if DPW ever does 

become aware of it and take a look at it, they probably will 

want parking, and how that will work without a curb.  To be 

worked out in the future.         

          ROBERT LINN:  To be determined, correct.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, so DPW's memo 

to the Board does talk quite a bit about their concerns and 

questions about this.  So I guess have you had a chance to

review that, or respond to it yet?         

          ROBERT LINN:  We've reviewed DPW's memo.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.         

          ROBERT LINN:  But we haven’t had any further 

discussions with DPW about that, yep.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

questions?  Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Are these rental units, or are they 

being sold as condos?         

          ROBERT LINN:  To be determined.       

          MARY FLYNN:  To be determined, okay.  Well, I 

noted in the CDD staff memo, they noted the four bedrooms, 

which is a wonderful thing.  The city has been a proponent 

of the larger-sized units for families.   

          If they are rental units, there's always a chance 

of four college students moving into the place too, given 

the number of universities in the area.  So I would just 

encourage you in your marketing to try to get to families as 

much as possible. 

          And the two -- I see you're taking two trees down.  

Are those being replaced anywhere, or is it just -- I know 

you're putting in more landscaping, but --

          ROBERT LINN:  Yep.       

          MARY FLYNN:  The trees that are shown all seem to 

be existing.         

          ROBERT LINN:  So the trees that are noted in red 

are the ones that the city would deem significant, based on 

the tree ordinance.  And these two trees, when we first were 

looking at them, were also deemed to be significant.   

          But when Duncan first purchased the property, he 

had an arborist come out, and both of these trees were 

considered to be unhealthy.  And so, the city granted a 

permit for the removal of both of these trees. 

          So these two that are shown right now don't exist, 

currently.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay, thank you.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Going back to DPW's, 20/70 

first floor elevation, back to that, a --        

          ROBERT LINN:  Yeah.    

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- very -- curb cut, are you 

removing the utility pole on the corner?         

          ROBERT LINN:  Our intent is to keep the utility 

pole, yep.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It looks like it would be in 

your sidewalk, correct me.  There's no curb line there, 

right?         

          ROBERT LINN:  We're just -- our thought was to 

keep it as currently existing.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Easement, why aren't you 

using that easement area for your occupant?         

          ROBERT LINN:  Duncan could speak to this better 

than I could, but I believe the easement is for the other 

units.  They have rights to park on that spot.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The adjacent building?         

          ROBERT LINN:  The adjacent building.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  To this property?         

          ROBERT LINN:  Yep.  They have an easement to park 

in that little, trapezoidal space.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And the metal cladding, will 

it be colored, or will it be --   

          ROBERT LINN:  I think it's probably going to be a 

colored, probably in a gray tone, but not -- just a bright, 

not a bright metal, not just natural metal, yeah.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  20/70 height.

          ROBERT LINN:  So we did some initial investigation 

when we saw that memo.  We had our civil engineers take a 

look at the flood maps.  The idea is that in that time, 

there's some possibility that the 56R, which is where we 

have the parking, would be in the floodplain, but the 

building itself was always, even in the 20/70, was out of 

the floodplain.  We're not actually going to have any 

basement in the building.   

          And so, I think, you know, we will be able to 

mitigate, you know, whatever we need to do in terms of 

stormwater, both through stormwater drainage, which is 

currently through -- there's a stormwater pipe in the 

building that's going to collect currently and in the future 

all the water from the roof, but we also have the potential 

to do some sort of CULTEC system in that 56R to hold some of 

the additional water.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So you don't expect to be 

higher than the 20/70 elevation?         

          ROBERT LINN:  We do not.  I mean, our building 

will be out of the floodplain 20/70 in our understanding.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay.  I guess I need some 

clarification on that one.

          ROBERT LINN:  So 50 -- the 56R section of the 

site, this section, at least based on the city maps and our 

understanding, is possibly in that 20/70 zone.  But the 

actual footprint of the building, as far as we understand 

it, is out of the zone of the flood plain.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY: Other questions?  

Okay.  Then we can have a Board discussion and comments on 

where we are in terms of the findings that we need to make.  

Tom?         

          THOMAS DALY:  Well, just going through the list of 

findings, we were to determine whether the increased number 

of dwelling units will increase the on-street parking demand 

in the neighborhood, and the plans as detailed tonight are 

clear that the parking is amply accommodated on the owners' 

land.  In fact, it doubled the number of cars with the guest 

parking spaces, at the request of the neighborhood. 

          The question of privacy --  and the neighbors very 

much appreciate the time that the neighbors, the direct 

abutters are taking tonight to come out and reassure this 

Board and the city that there's been a very rich 

conversation between yourselves and the developers to make 

sure that your particular concerns were addressed.  I really

appreciate that.  That reassures me that there's been 

outreach in the community, and further reference by other 

neighbors about discussions about mechanicals and cladding.   

          So I really appreciate that.  That evidence 

presented tonight took really careful consideration.  There 

will be an ongoing conversation, I'm sure, of relative to 

construction issues. 

          And then lastly, consideration about allowing a 

special permit to put parking within the setback, and this 

is clearly an unusual site, given the proximity to the rail 

line.   

          I don't understand what would be the value of 

enforcing a five-foot setback from the rail line, given that 

that’s a -- noisy and obnoxious use, and seems to make sense 

to use it for parking on the stretch of land that would 

complement that utility. 

          So I -- as far as the findings go, I'm comforted 

that I'd be able to make the findings in the affirmative for 

the special permit.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I really like the 

project.  There's been some really lovely renovations of old

factory buildings in this area.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And I think this would be a 

nice addition to it.  I went down there last evening, I've 

seen it many, many times I went there, and many, many times 

I wanted to see it in the dark.  And I think this would be a 

great addition to the neighborhood.   

          Because right now it just ends in the dark pit of 

the block with this building.  And then the driveway area, 

and the railroad tracks. 

          I'm glad to know the trees were removed, because I 

spent a lot of time trying to find where the trees were, 

that were going to be removed.  And I just couldn't make it 

out.  So I'm glad to know they're gone.   

          You know, I think you can make all the findings 

that are requested.  I have no problems with their being a 

lack of setback from the railroad tracks.   

          And, you know, aesthetically I think it's very 

interesting looking.  I understand what they're saying and 

what they're doing, and I think that’s -- you know, will 

benefit the homes and the public.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary?

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, I agree with my colleagues.  I 

would have no problem making the findings that we are asked 

to make this evening.  I too love the building, I think it's 

done very, very well.  I particularly like the screening, 

that you've worked out with the neighbors.  I think it's not 

only attractive, but it solves the problem.   

          And as Tom said, it's very reassuring and really 

quite wonderful to have this kind of dialogue go on between 

the neighbors and the proponent. 

          So yeah, I'm good.  Thank you.  Appreciate it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Well, I also think this is an 

excellent project.  But I think the street façade is really 

unnecessarily harsh and forbidding, and three blank panels 

in the middle of a building that are (sic) two stories tall.  

          And so I started sketching windows in there, and 

it -- actually if you're looking five of the six places, a 

little window would be fine.  You get light in your laundry, 

you get light in your bathrooms, et cetera.   

          I didn't like the looks of that, but, you know, 

maybe you put a big window in the laundry that matches the 

other one of those.  Maybe change the metal siding and the

texture in some way to delineate between the two units?  I 

think something -- I'd like to see something that makes it a 

little more elaborate.  But I don't have a lot of experience 

with think of architectural style, so I don't quite know 

what that would be. 

          So, but beyond that I think -- I do think it's a 

very, very good project.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou's good?  

Steve, anything?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Good.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So in terms of my own 

comment, I think my only concerns about this are that 

there's enough unknowns going on with the public right of 

way that I'm almost concerned you're going to be back here 

to talk to us again.   

          I expect that Traffic and Parking is not likely to 

put parking along that extended sidewalk in, unless there is 

a full curb put in.  And I expect they'll want one.  That's 

a guess, but that's -- I think likely, unless the Fire 

Department wants it not curbed for emergency vehicle access, 

which is also possible.   

          All of it needs a curb cut permit to reconfigure.

So all of those issues are going to be worked out, as well 

the location of the utility pole in the sidewalk.  So all of 

that has to be worked out before you're building.   

          I am reassured that DPW's memo says that they're 

confident that you will be able to meet the requirements.  

I'm just a little nervous about how much your operations are 

dependent on the configuration you have now. 

          I think it's fine the way it is now, but you have 

the -- it's a tight enough site with enough going on, not to 

mention the sewer -- is it water and sewer easement?  Yeah, 

the sewer line that we need to make sure is acknowledged, 

that there's an easement for it. 

          So there's a lot going on here, and that I feel 

like you could be back here.  But that's the worst-case 

scenario, is that something changes, and you end up having 

to come back.  Hopefully, the changes are minor enough that 

it can be handled through staff Design Review. 

          I think, similarly, Hugh's comments about 

softening textures and adding windows, I personally agree 

with those from an aesthetic point of view, but also think 

that they could be handled through Design Review.  Okay.  

I'm just making sure that that's where we're headed on that.

All right.   

          The parking setback usually I would agree, 

especially in light of there's going to be a future bike 

path, that we would want to protect that setback.   

          But where that bike path is already going to be 

part of the MBTA right of way, staff looked at that, and 

said that the setback was okay, so they know more about the 

plans for that future bike path than I do.  So I feel 

comfortable that that is appropriate in this case. 

          Jeff, is there anything we haven't gone over that 

we need to?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No, I don't think so.  I think the 

comments are fairly brief and laid out in the --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- memo, both from Public Works and 

from CDD.  And I think CDD has recommended some -- design 

team some items of continuing review.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I'm sure the façade, if there 

were to be a statement, decision about allowing approaches 

to the façade that will help to -- I guess to differentiate 

different parts of the façade a little bit more -- certainly

something that could be communicated through design review.   

          And then the -- as you noted, the issues about the 

public realm.  I think their design staff had been talking 

with Public Works about this, and particularly the idea, you 

know, if -- could this be a place where the sidewalk is 

extended, and if it's wide enough, could street trees be 

planted as part of that.  That's something that the Planning 

Board could mention, or sort of recommend as part of these.  

But it requires working out --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- that with Public Works.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So I think 

then, what I'm hearing is that the Board is prepared to make 

the necessary findings, incorporating the conditions and 

continuing review of the issues, as laid out in both the CDD 

and DPW memos.  Is that --      

          COLLECTIVE:  Mm-hm, yes.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Does 

someone want to make a motion to make the necessary findings 

and grant the requested permits?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  I would move that the Board 

makes the findings that are outlined in the memo.  

44

Increasing the number of dwelling units is not going to 

increase on the street parking demand in the neighborhood.  

          That the location, orientation and use of the 

structure and the yard of the new housing will not impact 

the privacy of residential neighbors, that's been mitigated. 

          Make the finding that due consideration has been 

given to address the impacts of the reduction of private 

open space here with the roof decks, and that reasonable 

efforts have been taken to address concerns raised by 

neighbors and abutters.   

          And further, that we can make the finding that the 

placement of the parking space within the five-foot setback 

of the parking lot, not impact the city, given its special 

location adjacent to the MBTA rail line. 

          And based on those findings, I would propose that 

we grant the special permit.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor?   

          [ All 7 vote YES ]

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excuse me, we're 

still in session.  We're trying to move on with our agenda.   

if you could have the discussion outside that would be most 

appreciated.    

          Okay, so the next item on our agenda is the 

extension to file the written decision for the 31 Church 

Street special permit.  This is a retail cannabis 

application.  We have received a letter from the applicant 

asking -- consenting to extending that decision deadline to 

February 10.  May I have a motion to extend the deadline to 

February 10, 2010?

right.  We have the highlight of the evening, then, is our 

last item on the agenda, election of the Planning Board 

Chair.  We'll accept nominations.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I would ask the current Chair 

whether she would be willing to serve for another 12 months?  

You've done an exemplary job.  I think you're just getting 

your stride, actually.  You will do even better in the next 

12 months, year for the city.  I would like to see your name 

as a nomination.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  I am 

willing to serve, but if anyone else is willing to take up 

the mantle, I certainly would not be offended.  No other 

nominations? All right.  So, on the -- I guess motion to 

elect myself -- this is so weird -- I elect Catherine 

Preston Connolly to another one-year term as Planning Board 

Chair.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:   All those in favor?

right.  And then on the matter of Vice Chair, I have been 

advised that my excellent current Vice Chair, Ted, has asked 

to be relieved, and therefore I would like to nominate Mary 

Flynn to step into the role as Vice Chair for 2020.  Are 

there other nominations? Mary, are you willing to serve?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, but as with yourself, if there's 

anybody else who would like to, I'm certainly willing to -- 

no, I'm very interested, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It has been noted by 

staff that should both Mary and I not be available, there 

are many experienced Board members who can step in, should 

it be needed.  So we are grateful for the deep bench that we 

have here. 

          So on the matter of electing Mary Flynn to Vice 

Chair of the Planning Board,  all those in favor?

right.  Well, Happy New Year, everyone.  Unless I'm missing
